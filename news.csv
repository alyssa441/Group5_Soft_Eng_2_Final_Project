At least 1,200 indigenous peoples (IPs) from the towns of Floridablanca and Porac, and the city of Mabalacat will benefit in the upland vegetable farming program initiated by the provincial government of Pampanga and Department of Labor and Employment (DoLE).

This initiative, which is part of the Tulong Panghanapbuhay sa Ating Disadvantaged/Displaced Workers (Tupad) program, will ensure food security while providing livelihood opportunities for IPs.

Under the program, members of the Aeta communities will plant vegetables such as tomatoes, squash, and eggplant for their own consumption or for selling.

In a statement, Gov. Dennis Pineda said the concept of cultivating the land for vegetable farming for the Aetas is a replication of the Season-Long Training on Vegetable Production project for IPs in Floridablanca in 2017.

""This will be modeled after the Department of Agriculture's Plant, Plant, Plant program to aid them in their daily needs as well as help them generate income through their harvest,"" he said.

Labor Secretary Silvestre Bello 3rd lauded the provincial government for its effort to provide emergency livelihood assistance to the marginalized sectors of the society, including Aetas and other IPs.

""We need to take care of them [IPs]. Let us look at their needs, let's provide emergency livelihood, let's take care of their health. With the help and support of the province of Pampanga and Gov. Pineda, we are able to do it,"" Bello said.

Tupad is a community-based package of assistance providing emergency employment for displaced workers, underemployed and seasonal workers, for a minimum period of 10 days but not to exceed a maximum of 30 days, depending on the nature of work to be performed.",REAL

IN line with the Duterte administration's commitment to address insurgencies and other local conflicts in various areas, the team of Sen. Christopher Lawrence ""Bong"" Go distributed assistance to hundreds of families under the Retooled Community Support Program in the far-flung areas of Basey, Samar on July 14 as part of the senator's efforts to support conflict-affected local communities.

Go's staff conducted the relief operation at Sitio Borabod, Barangay Mabini where they assisted 307 families.

Go's outreach team distributed meals, masks, face shields and vitamins to the beneficiaries. In addition, some recipients received new pairs of shoes.

In his video message, Go urged those who were on the priority list to get vaccinated against Covid-19 for the country to achieve herd immunity.

""Alam ko pong mahirap ang panahon ngayon. Nasa krisis po tayo dulot po ng Covid-19 pandemic. Mga kababayan ko, ang bakuna po ang pag-asa natin dito. Magtiwala ho kayo sa bakuna. Ang bakuna po ang tanging susi para unti-unti na tayong makabalik sa ating normal na pamumuhay (I know the situation now is difficult. We are undergoing a crisis due to the Covid-19 pandemic. My countrymen, the vaccine is our hope in this situation. Trust the vaccine. This is the only key for us to slowly return to our normal lives),"" said Go.

""Ang ating target ngayon ay makamtan natin ang population protection at herd immunity po. Sana po bago mag-Pasko para naman po sumaya ang ating Pasko (Our current target is to achieve population protection and herd immunity. Hopefully, we can achieve this before Christmas in order for it to be merry),"" he added.

Through its representatives for the Assistance to Individuals in Crisis Situation program, the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) gave financial assistance to each beneficiary.
The Department of Trade and Industry assessed eligible recipients that would benefit from its ""Pangkabuhayan sa Pagbangon"" at Ginhawa program.

Likewise, the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority offered scholarship grants to qualified beneficiaries. The Office of Civil Defense also distributed health kits.
As an advocate for quality health care, the senator advised the beneficiaries, particularly the poor and indigent patients, to visit the Malasakit Center at the Samar Provincial Hospital in Catbalogan City for medical needs and hospital billing assistance.

Under the Malasakit Centers Act, all hospitals administered and managed by the Department of Health (DoH) and the Philippine General Hospital were mandated to have its own Malasakit Center that shall provide convenient access to medical assistance programs offered by concerned agencies such as DoH, DSWD, Philippine Health Insurance Corp. and Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office.

To boost infrastructure development needed to help address root causes of insurgency in the provinces, Go, as vice chair of the Senate Committee on Finance, pushed for the funding of numerous projects in the area such as the rehabilitation and improvement of the farm-to-market road from Barangay New San Agustin to Barangay Cogon as well as the construction and concreting of the access road from Literon-Antol in Calbiga to Canlobo-Layo-Magdawat-Pelaon of Pinabacdao and to Mabini in Basey, connecting Lulugayan Falls and Kanyawa Cave to Macatingol Cave and Sohoton Cave.

He also supported initiatives to improve roads and other public structures throughout the province such as the construction of a multipurpose hall in Catbalogan City and Tarangnan, concreting of roads in Daram, construction of farm-to-market roads in Pinabacdao, construction of a shoreline-protection structure in Tagapul-an and the construction of a public park in Tarangnan, among others.
Several local government officials were commended by Go for their service to their constituents during this time of crisis. Among the officials were Rep. Sharee Ann Tan, Gov. Reynolds Michael Tan, Vice Gov. Angelica Gomez, Mayor Luz Ponferrada and Vice Mayor Honesto Zeta, among others.

On June 12, Go sent his outreach team to deliver assistance to 10 displaced families, who were affected by a recent fire incident in Basey.",REAL

GENEVA: Extreme weather events and natural disasters will continue to increase, an expert and the head of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) warned on Monday (Tuesday in Manila), saying climate change was the root cause for the torrential rainstorms and deadly floods ravaging across Western Europe this summer.

Speaking exclusively to Xinhua, Petteri Taalas, secretary general of the Geneva-based WMO, said: ""We have always had extreme weather events, but because of climate change, we have started seeing them more often and they are more intense.""

""Without climate change we wouldn't have observed such high temperatures in western parts of Canada and the US, so that's a clear indication of climate change,"" he said.
At the same time, devastating flash floods due to heavy rainfalls have swept through several western European countries in the past few days, killing more than 100 and causing huge damages.

In the report ""Summer of extremes: floods, heat and fire,"" the WMO said on Friday that some parts of Western Europe received up to two months worth of rainfall in two days (July 14 and 15) on soils that were already near saturation.

""The top one meter of soil was completely saturated or well above field capacity after the intense rain in the most affected regions of Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and Germany,"" it said.

Asked about whether he expected more natural disasters over the next couple of years, Taalas said: ""Climate change will anyhow continue for the coming decades. If we are successful with climate mitigation, we could stop this negative trend in the 2060s.""

""Until then we will see a growing amount of natural disasters and a growing amount of this kind of weather extremes and also more human losses and more economic losses than before,"" he warned.

""That means that we have to also adapt to climate change, the most important thing is to mitigate climate change, to stop using fossil fuels and also pay attention to our diet.""

Countries around the world have pledged to reach a global peak of greenhouse gas emissions as soon as possible and to achieve a climate neutral world by mid-century.

The Paris Agreement, which was adopted by 196 parties in Paris in 2015, sets a target of holding the global average rise in temperature below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and preferably below 1.5 C.

Taalas also stressed that no region in the world was safe from the negative impacts from extreme weather events and natural disasters.

""One could say that it's a global thing. Last year, we had severe drought in the same areas where we now have these problems in North America and also in South America in the Amazon region with also record-breaking drought.""",REAL

BACOLOD CITY: Former representative Alfredo Abelardo Benitez formally announced on Monday that he is running for mayor of Bacolod City in the 2022 elections.

Benitez, currently the provincial consultant for trade and investment promotions, ended months of speculation after he applied for the transfer of his voter's registration from Victorias City to Bacolod City.

Benitez will go up against incumbent Mayor Evelio Leonardia, who is seeking his third and last term.

""I have seen enough. I have heard enough. The clamor of the people of Bacolod City for change is undeniable. I am officially declaring that I will run for mayor of Bacolod City in 2022,"" Benitez declared during Monday's press conference at Manokan Country.

  
Benitez was undefeated in his three consecutive terms as representative of Negros Occidental's third district and was considered as one of the richest members of Congress during his term.

Benitez clarified that he has nothing personal against Leonardia.
""It is not that I want to be mayor to be popular. This is about the clamor of the people,"" he pointed out.

""This is like a situation where you see a person drowning in corruption. I cannot turn my back because I know I can save that person from drowning,"" he added.

Benitez also bared that his focus was to bring ""change and better governance, save the city from corruption and put the city to greater heights because Bacolod City has been left behind, compared to its neighboring highly urbanized cities.""

""We should give Bacolod voters a chance to freely make their choice for their future,"" Benitez added.

When asked about his possible running mates, Benitez said, ""For now, I have decided for myself, and after a couple of weeks, I will reveal my lineup.""

The former representative also said he attended the hearing on the opposition filed against his transfer of voting registration.

Benitez said they presented enough evidence that he was a resident of Bacolod City.

""After 2019, I did not run for any position. I have been a provincial consultant with an office in Bacolod City. I have started, then, my journey in Bacolod City,"" he added.

""This is the first time the Philippines has received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, a safe, trusted and easy to store shot widely used in the US,"" Rose said.

""We continue to appeal to Congress to pass this anti-endo law as the term of the President ends,"" Palace spokesman Harry Roque Jr. said.

The Philippine National Police (PNP) on Wednesday said the designation of the National Democratic Front (NDF) as a terrorist group by the Anti-Terrorism Council was a wise move to defeat communist insurgency.

In a statement, PNP chief Police General Guillermo Eleazar said the designation will pave the way for an “all-out operations” against the group, including a “legal offensive.”

“Sa pagdeklara ng NDF na isang teroristang grupo, mawawalan na ng palusot ang mga taong ito (With the declaration of the NDF as a terrorist group, the rebels will no longer have excuses),” he said.

“Lalo lang mapapalakas ang ating mga operasyon upang tuluyan nang wakasan ang mga grupong ito (It will only strengthen our operation to eliminate these groups),” he added.

According to Eleazar, many members of the communist groups were using the excuse of being  peace talk consultants to circumvent arrest. 
On Tuesday, the Department of National Defense (DND) and Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) also expressed support for the designation of NDF as a terrorist group over its links to communist rebels.

According to the ATC, the NDF is “an integral and inseparable part” of the Communist Party of the Philippines-New People’s Army (CPP-NPA), which were designated as terror groups last December.

The designation would allow the government to freeze assets of the NDF, which was established in April 1973.

A request for delisting may be filed before the ATC within 15 days from publication of the designation.

In April, the ATC designated as terrorists exiled CPP founding chairman Jose Maria Sison, his wife Julieta, and the rest of the 19-member central committee of the CPP.

Sison dismissed the designation as “arbitrary and dubious.”

Austin will arrive in the Philippines on July 29 as part of his Southeast Asian tour that will also include stops in Singapore and Vietnam.

Lorenzana told reporters the agenda of the meeting still needs to be ironed out, but he expects the two sides to talk about the Visiting Forces Agreement, Mutual Defense Treaty, the status of bilateral relations, and the developments in the West Philippine Sea.

The Philippines and US defense chiefs previously agreed to have a face-to-face meeting.

In a phone call with Lorenzana last February, Austin reaffirmed the US’ commitment to its security alliance with the Philippines through the MDT and VFA, which is currently under review.

“The VFA will not be changed. There will be a side agreement to implement the provisions of the VFA. Once it is signed by the President, that will be an official document that is attached to the VFA,” Lorenzana said in a briefing ahead of President Rodrigo Duterte’s final State of the Nation Address on July 26.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will decide “in one to two weeks” on the use of Sinovac’s COVID-19 vaccine on children and adolescents, Director General Eric Domingo said Wednesday.

In an interview on Super Radyo dzBB, Domingo said vaccine experts are still clarifying certain matters with the Chinese drugmaker in connection with its application to revise the emergency use authorization issued for its COVID-19 vaccine. 

Currently, the Sinovac jab is only approved for use on individuals aged 18 and above. 

“‘Yung sa Sinovac, ‘yung application nila is 3 years old and above so ito po ‘yung tinitingnan pa ng mga vaccine experts natin and tingin po natin, siguro in one to two weeks magkakaroon na tayo ng decision doon sa evaluation,” he said.

(Sinovac’s application is for 3 years and above so that is what our vaccine experts are looking at now. Maybe in one to two weeks, we will reach a decision on the evaluation.)

(We’re conducting thorough due diligence since the study was not held here and we also have a stringent regulatory authority.)

Domingo reiterated, however, that children and adolescents are not yet a priority in the country’s inoculation campaign due to the scarce vaccine supply. 

He explained that the vaccination program is targeting the elderly and persons with comorbidities since children are at lowest risk for severe illness or death from COVID-19.

“Eventually, darating din naman tayo doon basta 'yung supplies natin maging sapat na (We’ll get there once supplies are enough) for everybody,” Domingo assured.

In an interview on ""Unang Balita,"" Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said the DOH “immediately investigated” the incident in Guiguinto involving the wake of Katrina Santos, who died of cerebrovascular disease and later tested positive for COVID-19. 

“May mga protocol po tayo ngayon sa ating mga facilities na kailangan 'pag pumapasok ang isang pasyente sa ospital, na-de-determine natin if they are COVID or non-COVID so alam nila kung saan nila ilalagay na ward,” Vergeire said.

Contact tracing is also underway, with 15 people set to undergo a swab test. The embalmer is already under quarantine and will take a COVID-19 test.

“Binabantayan sila ngayon ng tao namin (Our staffers are monitoring them),” Cruz said.

‘Expanded, aggressive tracing’

In a separate interview on Super Radyo dzBB, DOH Central Luzon regional director Dr. Corazon Flores said Santos was rushed to the hospital because of uncontrolled hypertension that resulted in bleeding cerebrovascular disease.

Then, the hospital conducted a post-mortem swab test on the patient to ensure that she was not positive for COVID-19. However, the swab results only came out two days later.

Flores said the Bulacan Medical Center immediately coordinated with the Guiguinto municipal health officer. The funeral service was halted and Santos’s remains were cremated.

“What we need to do now is really to trace back kung sinong mga naging contact (who were the contacts) [and] to interview the family [to ask] even before the patient was brought to the hospital, who were the contacts?” she said.

“Ang napakahalaga po dito ay ang (What’s really important here is) expanded and aggressive contact tracing,” she added.

Under DOH protocols, suspected, probable, and confirmed COVID-19 cases must be buried or cremated within 12 hours after their death.

The Philippines rose a few notches in a global ranking of mobile and fixed broadband internet speeds, according to the latest figures released by global speed monitoring firm Speedtest by Ookla.

advertisement
In the June 2021 Ookla Speedtest Global Index report, the country climbed two spots to 75th in terms of mobile internet speed from 77th in May out of 137 countries included in the list.

Ookla figures show that the Philippines’ average mobile internet download speed reached 32.84 megabits per second (Mbps), an increase of 0.86 from the recorded 31.98 Mbps in May.

Mobile upload speed also slightly improved to 8.92 Mbps from 8.74 Mbps in the prior month.

In terms of fixed broadband, the Philippines climbed three spots to 62 from 65th out of 181 countries.

The country’s average fixed broadband download speed stood at 66.55 Mbps, a 6.82 increase from 59.73 Mbps speed recorded in May.

Fixed broadband upload speed, likewise, rose to 66.86 Mbps from 57.40 Mbps in the prior month.

The Ookla Speedtest Global Index considers countries with at least 300 unique user results for mobile or fixed broadband to be ranked in either category.

“The continuous upward trend in PH Internet speeds is a welcome development in our efforts to prepare for full participation in the global digital economy,” Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT) Secretary Gregorio Honasan II said in a statement.

The DICT chief said the upward trend gained traction after President Rodrigo Duterte issued directives last July 2020 challenging telcos to shape up and called on government agencies to provide assistance to telcos by streamlining the tower permitting process.

Last July 1, 2021, the DICT and the Anti-Red Tape Authority (ARTA) also revised and expanded Joint Memorandum Circular (JMC) No 001, s. 2021 to harmonize the provisions of the policy and Republic Act No. 11494 or the Bayanihan to Recover as One Act.

The DICT said the JMC has been instrumental in reducing procedural delays in securing the necessary permits and documentary requirements in the construction of common towers.

According to ARTA, the policy shortened the timeline to the target period of 16 days compared to the original 214 days. It also brought down permits from 30 to eight and documentary requirements from 86 to 35.

“For the rest of 2021 and in the succeeding years, your DICT shall continue to support the industries for telecommunications and information services to ensure that our Internet speed rankings will continue its upward climb,” Honasan said.—AOL, GMA News",REAL

(CNN) — Jeff Bezos, the world's richest man, went to space and back Tuesday morning on an 11-minute, supersonic joy ride aboard the rocket and capsule system developed by his space company, Blue Origin.

Riding alongside the multibillionaire were Bezos' brother, Mark Bezos; Wally Funk, an 82-year-old pilot and one of the ""Mercury 13"" women who trained to go to space in the 20th century but never got to fly; and an 18-year old recent high school graduate named Oliver Daemen who was Blue Origin's first paying customer and whose father, an investor, purchased his ticket.

Funk and Daemen became the oldest and youngest people, respectively, ever to travel to space. And this flight marked the first-ever crewed mission for Blue Origin's New Shepard suborbital space tourism rocket, which the company plans to use to take wealthy thrill seekers on high-flying joy rides in the months and years to come.

The four passengers on Tuesday strapped into their New Shepard crew capsule at Blue Origin's launch site in rural West Texas just before the rocket lit its engines at 8:12 am CT, sending the vehicle blaring past the speed of sound and up to more than 65 miles above the desert landscape, topping out at an altitude of 351,210 feet. At the peak of the flight path, the passengers were weightless for about three minutes and were allowed to unstrap themselves from their seat to float around and soak in panoramic views of the Earth and the cosmos.

The launch was visible to reporters on the ground, with the rocket streaking across the almost cloudless Texas sky with a blooming contrail. The bright blaze of the rocket engine looked almost like a star or planet as it rose into the sky. Bezos and crew could be heard on Blue Origin's livestream cheering as they moved about the capsule during the microgravity portion of the flight.

Metro Manila (CNN Philippines, July 21) — Senate President Tito Sotto III questioned the recent proposal of Malacañang to end illegal contractualization in the country, which President Rodrigo Duterte already vetoed two years ago.

""The President vetoed it. What do they want us to do? We passed it,"" Sotto told CNN Philippines' The Source in a taped interview on Wednesday.

READ: Palace calls on Congress to pass anti-endo bill as Duterte’s term nears end 

Sotto referred to Duterte's two-page veto message sent to the 17th Congress which passed the consolidated Senate Bill 1826 and House Bill 6908 or the ""Security of Tenure and End of Endo Act.""

""End of contract"" or ""endo"" is a highly contested form of contractualization widely practiced in the country, where workers are hired for not more than five months so employers don't need to regularize them on the sixth month as mandated by the Labor Code. It strips millions of workers of all the benefits granted by law to regular employees.

In his veto message dated July 26, 2019, Duterte noted that even if the bill codifies into law existing rules on labor-only contracting and security of tenure, ""it likewise unduly broadens the scope and definition of prohibited labor-only contracting, effectively proscribing forms of contractualization that are not particularly unfavorable to the employees involved.""

He also cited the need to balance the concerns of employers and employees.

Sotto called out Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque for insinuating that Congress did not act on the measure.

In a notice, the ATC issued a resolution “directing the issuance of Sanctions Freeze Order to take effect immediately against the National Democratic Front (NDF), also known as the National Democratic Front of the Philippines (NDFP), pursuant to its designation as terrorist by the Anti-Terrorism Council (ATC) Resolution No. 21 (2021) dated 23 June 2021, and the freezing without delay of the following property or funds, including related accounts.”

The ATC earlier referred to the NDFP as an “integral and inseparable part” of the Communist Party of the Philippines and its military arm, the New People’s Army. Both the CPP and NPA were likewise tagged as “terrorist organizations” in December last year.

Metro Manila (CNN Philippines, July 20) — The Commission on Elections will keep a close watch on online campaign spending starting October, but the law prevents it from holding candidates accountable for premature campaigning, an official said Tuesday.

Comelec spokesperson James Jimenez told CNN Philippines some of the politicians' social media posts and other activities now may be tantamount to premature campaigning, but not under Republic Act 9639.

The law states that someone who submits a certificate of candidacy, or COC, shall only be considered a candidate and be held liable for ""unlawful acts or omissions"" once the official campaign period starts. That's February 8 for the 2022 elections.

""Talagang lahat ng pwede nilang gawin, pwede lang natin sitahin, pwede lang natin i-regulate (We can only call out and regulate their actions) at the start of the campaign period, kasi (because) that's the only time they become official candidates,"" Jimenez explained.

""That's already premature campaigning, you know it is. But it's not something that is legally actionable. It's not something we can take action against,"" he added.

Jimenez, director of Comelec's education and information department, said the law needs to be amended. For now, Comelec can only monitor campaign activities of those who will file their COCs from October 1 to 8.

The poll body is also working on the guidelines for the computation of campaign advertisements on social media.

""The Comelec will start monitoring October 1 so that we know, even though there's not really a whole lot we can do with it, we know how much they're spending. We have an idea of what sort of spending is going on because even now, there's a lot of reporting coming out about how much these people spend,"" Jimenez said.

He also said the Comelec supports the bills seeking to increase the authorized campaign expenses, to allow for more virtual instead of face-to-face campaigning amid the pandemic.

In June 2020, the House of Representatives passed a bill raising the campaign spending limit from ₱10 to ₱50 per voter for presidential and vice presidential candidates. Under the proposal, those running for the Senate can also spend up to ₱50 per voter while political parties can shell out up to ₱30 for local candidates and ₱50 for national bets. A similar bill is pending in the Senate, but with a lower ₱20 cap for both candidates and political parties.

Candidates are required to submit their Statements of Contributions and Expenditures by June 8, 2022. Jimenez said this will be compared with the reports from social media platforms to check if there is underreporting or overspending.

""If it was done accurately, then there's no problem. If the report misstates a fact, then you have grounds for a legal complaint,"" he said.",REAL

“I have tasked the Manila Police District to deploy additional policemen in the area to ensure that persons who visit the beach observe minimum public health safety standards and follow quarantine protocols,” said Eleazar in a statement.

The dolomite beach was opened again to the public on July 18 and visitors are required to wear face shields and face masks.

Eleazar noted that throngs of visitors last year failed to observe social distancing, which resulted in the relief of a Manila police official for failure to impose health protocols in the area.

“May pulis na na-relieve sa puwesto dahil sa insidente noong nakaraang taon kaya’t babala ko din sa ating kapulisan na huwag magpabaya at siguraduhing mababantayan nila ang lugar para hindi na magkatanggalan pa,” he stated.

[Translation: One cop was relieved from the post because of the incident last year, that’s why I am warning our police to avoid being careless and make sure that they can monitor the area to avoid another relief.]

President Rodrigo Duterte on Monday ordered the Department of the Interior and Local Government and the PNP to implement existing health protocols “with greater urgency and necessity” due to the threat of Delta variant.

Visitors are only allowed to roam around the dolomite beach for only five minutes to avoid overcrowding, the PNP said.",REAL

A Twitter netizen using the handle @RodyOrtea caught GMA News for allegedly spreading fake news and put the station on a very awkward and embarrassing situation. 

Rody Ortea called out GMA News and Philippine Fact-Checkers on social media, particularly Rappler and Vera Files, if they are ready to play a game. 


The concerned netizen posted two articles both from GMA News and the original article posted by Daily Mail, one of the world's leading news outlet. It is clearly seen that the photo used by GMA News is the same with the original photo posted by Daily Mail. 

Rudy Ortea issued the dare to the major news network after he caught GMA News sharing a photo from a certain Liz Derr of Simularity, a tech company, who claimed the Chinese are dumping human waste and sewage in the South China Sea. 

It turned out that the photo was from Daily Mail Australia showing the impact of dredging and dumping has on Australia's Great Barrier Reef. 

Netizens reacted with the recent expose on social media regarding the controversial post of GMA News and the silence of the country's Facebook Fact Checkers.

https://philnewscourier.blogspot.com/2018/09/pnp-prepares-to-arrest-trillanes.html","PNP Prepares to Arrest Trillanes Anytime After Duterte Revoked Amnesty
https://philnewscourier.blogspot.com/2018/09/pnp-prepares-to-arrest-trillanes.html

The Philippine National Police (PNP) led by its chief Oscar Albayalde is now preparing to arrest Sen. Antonio Trillanes IV anytime. This development comes after President Rodrigo Duterte revoked the amnesty granted to the senator by former president Benigno ‘Noynoy’ Aquino III back in December 2010, a few months after the presidential election.
“The grant of amnesty to former LTSG Antonio Trillanes IV under Proclamation No. 75 is declared void ab initio because he did not comply with the minimum requirements to qualify under the amnesty proclamation,” Duterte said on Proclamation 572 he signed last Tuesday, August 31, noting that the senator “never expressed his guilt for the crimes that he committed during the Oakwood Mutiny and the Manila Peninsula Siege.”

According to Duterte, Trillanes did not file an Official Amnesty Application Form as per certification dated August 30, 2018, issued by Lt. Col. Thea Joan Andrade, stating “there is no copy of his application for amnesty in the records.” In addition, the president ordered the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Court Marshall of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) to arrest Trillanes as soon as possible.

As a response, Trillanes questioned the timing of Duterte’s order saying it was released when the Senate is now set to investigate allegations against the security agency owned by Solicitor General Jose Calida’s family, accusing them of bagging 10 government contracts right after the latter’s appointment, and that it was published in a broadsheet at the same time that the president is in Israel for an official visit.

On the other hand, presidential spokesperson Harry Roque insisted that Duterte’s revocation for the amnesty of Trillanes has nothing to do with his being a staunch critic of the administration. “The past finally caught with Sen. Trillanes. He’s responsible for his current state now. He was the one who did the Oakwood mutiny, the Manila Peninsula siege. There is nothing political.” He said in a press briefing in Israel.


Meanwhile, the PNP has not yet announced as when they will arrest Trillaness and where he will be jailed. Nevertheless, there are now PNP-CDIG members outside the Senate apparently waiting for the Senate hearing to be finished, and that the soldier-turned-politician is likely to be arrested as soon as he gets out the Senate hall, and that he may be jailed at the PNP Custodial Center in Camp Crame, alongside with Liberal Party (LP) Senator Leila de Lima and Senator Ramon ‘Bong’ Revilla Jr.

https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/04/22/philippine-activists-charged-sedition-fake-news

Philippine authorities are increasingly using the Covid-19 pandemic and new public health restrictions as an excuse to charge political opponents and activists with criminal offenses.

The latest targets were seven activists trying to distribute food aid last week in Bulacan province, north of Manila, who were stopped by police. They now face charges of violating the emergency law on Covid-19 and incitement to commit sedition after newspapers and magazines with anti-government content were found in their vehicle. The activists, including former opposition congressman Ariel Casilao, said they had proper permits for their relief activity.

The inclusion of the charge of inciting sedition – encouraging people to act against the government -- against Casilao and the others raises concerns that the Duterte administration may try to exploit the crisis to crack down more broadly on political activism and dissent. With the country on lockdown, and police, military, and local government officials putting up checkpoints such as the one that stopped Casilao’s group, known activists and political opposition figures are at risk of being charged over what should be a purely public health driven campaign.

“Inciting to sedition” is also a charge that has frequently been used in the past against activists accused of being communist rebels, opening the door for the government to invoke its counterinsurgency apparatus.

In another prominent case, Edgar Labella, the mayor of Cebu City in the central Philippines, ordered the arrest on April 19 of Maria Victoria Beltran, an actress and screenwriter, for a Facebook post the mayor deemed “fake news.” Authorities detained Beltran for two nights, unnecessarily risking exposure to Covid-19, and allegedly arrested her without a warrant and denied her access to a lawyer.

Since the passage of the Covid-19 law last month, the authorities have investigated dozens of people and arrested several for posts on social media the government claims are “fake news.” Although “fake news” is not in any Philippine jurisprudence, the Covid-19 law does criminally penalize spreading “false information” related to the pandemic.

The Duterte administration has sought to increase its authoritarian grip on the country by politicizing the Covid-19 response at the expense of controlling the escalating pandemic. The government should signal that it’s taking the health crisis seriously. It could start by dropping the charges against Casilao, his colleagues, and Beltran, and ending politically motivated investigations of people’s reading materials and social media posts.",FAKE

https://www.manilatimes.net/2021/07/21/news/national/duterte-failed-to-fulfill-promises-ateneo-study/1807820

PRESIDENT Rodrigo Duterte failed to fulfill his promises to end crime, corruption and illegal drugs within three to six months after he got elected president, according to a study by the Ateneo School of Government.

""The President overestimated, exaggerated, hyped up the scale and gravity of the problem, which is already serious, and he underestimated the challenge of dealing with the problem on a national basis,"" according to former Education secretary Edilberto de Jesus, the main proponent of the study.

He said the administration viewed the drug problem as merely a law enforcement issue instead of listening to expert advice that it is also a public health and economic issue.

The former Education chief noted that the considerable powers granted to police officers in conducting the government's anti-drug campaign exposed weaknesses in the Philippine National Police.
He said the drug war has made extrajudicial killings (EJK) worse, as not only drug addict suspects were targeted but also leftist activists and their lawyers.

""Ang nagiging epekto ng drug war sa kapulisan mismo ay maaaring marami ang naniniwala na makakalusot sila kahit papaano dahil sa mayroon silang 'blank check' sa kung anong kailangan nilang gawin. At iyong EJK ay lumaganap na rin kaya nabahala na rin ang Department of Justice (In effect, the drug war showed that police officers believed that they could get away with anything they do given their blank check. EJK has worsened, and the DoJ has also raised concerns),"" de Jesus added.
He said the President has been heavily criticized for his government appointees, adding that no investigation was conducted for fired appointees, and some of them have also been recycled into another government post.

""All five fired officials [appointed at the beginning of Duterte's term] as well as others who later had to resign under public pressure were close to Duterte. Their separation from the service seemed to make good the President's threat to dispose of officials tainted by even a whiff of corruption. But no investigation or charges followed from the sacking, and the favorable impression gained by their dismissal quickly dissipated when they began surfacing in other government offices,"" de Jesus said.

Duterte downplays 'legacy'
The issue of transparency has been brought up as the President himself refused to disclose his SALN or Statement of Assets, Liabilities and Net Worth.

Despite the issuance of Executive Order 2 or the ""Freedom of Information Act,"" de Jesus said the early attempt to push for greater freedom of information in the government appeared to be a case of ""ningas kugon.""

Five years into the Duterte administration, the former Education secretary added, the issues of crime, corruption and illegal drugs are still persistent and have to be addressed.

""There are still a lot of problems that the country is facing, and he has to answer them, and we need to be on the lookout for how he will address these problems. He is still accountable; he is still responsible for these issues,"" de Jesus said.

Filipino celebrities and influencers earn hundreds of thousands to millions of pesos by amplifying – either knowingly or indirectly – government propaganda, false information, and fake networks that breed online disinformation, a Rappler investigation showed.

Celebrities’ endorsement of questionable content – done via sharing on their verified and official Facebook pages – is sinister, as it lends credibility and legitimacy to websites and pages that are out to pollute the online environment and spread disinformation. Such practice also lacks transparency, as posts appear as if they were organic or unpaid for.

Such is the case with digital marketing group Twinmark Media Enterprises, which Facebook banned in January 2019 due to coordinated inauthentic behavior. Twinmark assets also actively promoted government propaganda and disinformation, especially against government critics.
The strategy: Twinmark pays stars and influencers, as well as several popular meme and celebrity fan pages, to share content from Twinmark-owned websites to increase engagement.  The agency also has its own pages.

Facebook users that follow the celebrity, celebrity-linked, or popular pages get to see the posts, then be led to the Twinmark websites, and be served money-generating ads, false information, or propaganda. It’s a lucrative sport for everyone in the network.
In a legal document seen by Rappler, Facebook told the agency in January 2019: 

“It has come to our attention that your company, Twinmark Media Enterprises, Inc., has developed a network of Facebook pages and accounts that you exploit for financial gain through the use of multiple fake accounts working together to mislead people about the origin of content. Your accounts and pages post and share misleading content designed to induce users to visit your external websites that exist primarily to serve advertising. Moreover, you sell Facebook Pages and posts, enabling  the spread of unwanted spam content. Your activities are illegal and unauthorized and must stop immediately.”

Oftentimes, too, Twinmark-linked pages suddenly shift their identities and content – say, from entertainment to politics – usually to promote a politician or push out propaganda during an election season. A former Twinmark employee told Rappler they had several local and national politicians as clients.

What better way to spread their (dis) information than to use popular idols on mainstream and social media?

THE Department of Education (DepEd) has clarified blended distance learning will still be used for School Year 2021-2022, after President Rodrigo Duterte gave his approval for the opening of classes on September 13.

""Upon the approval of the President on the opening of classes on September 13, he has approved the continuous implementation of blended learning. He has not yet approved face-to-face instruction. I want to make it clear, it's still blended learning,"" Education Secretary Leonor Briones said.

School Year 2021-2022 will end on June 24, 2022.

Briones said by implementing blended learning, students and teachers will not be exposed to the risk of contracting Covid-19.
In preparation for the school opening, Education Undersecretary Nepomuceno Malaluan said experiences from the past school year will help shape the delivery of education for 2021-2022.

""The lessons we have learned with blended learning in the past school year will serve as our guide to improve the delivery of education to our students. For the upcoming school year, we will continue to use the streamlined curriculum of the Most Essential Learning Competencies,"" he added.
Malaluan said they are also conducting focused group discussions on best practices of teachers and schools to improve the implementation of blended learning.

Briones said her department will still propose the pilot implementation of limited face-to-face learning to the President.
""In the pilot study, we are suggesting limited face-to-face classes can be done in 100 schools. Let us test if we are able to successfully implement it,"" the DepEd chief added.

She recalled the President initially approved holding limited face-to-face classes in January, but with the UK or Alpha variant of Covid-19, he decided not to push through with the plan.

MARAWI CITY, Lanao del Sur: On Tuesday, July 20, the world's 1.5 billion Muslims will mark Eid al-Adha, the ""Festival of Sacrifice,"" the most important holiday in the Islamic calendar, according to a famous ulama (Muslim scholar) leader, Aleem Basher ""Mostagbal"" Manalao.

President Rodrigo Duterte had declared the ""Festival of Sacrifice"" as a regular holiday through Proclamation 1189.

Manalao, also a former Lanao del Sur governor, said Eid al-Adha is celebrated on the final day of the annual hajj pilgrimage to Mecca, the holiest city in Islam, in western Saudi Arabia.

All Muslims able to do so are asked to make the five-day hajj journey at least once in their lifetime, and at least two million do so each year.

At Mecca, worshippers visit the Kaabah shrine, Islam's most important monument, in the Grand Mosque.
Also known as the Black Stone, the Kaabah is believed to have been constructed by Ibrahim and Ismail.

Pilgrims also visit the Jamarat Bridge where Ibrahim was believed to have thrown stones at the devil, Manalao said.

The ulama said two major eid (festivals) are celebrated by Muslims worldwide.

The first, Eid al-Fitr, Arabic for ""Festival of the Breaking of the Fast,"" happens at the end of Ramadan, a month-long period when Muslims fast daily from sunrise to sunset.

Also known as Sawm, it is also one of the five pillars of the Islamic faith.

Ramadan marks the month Allah revealed the first verses of the Quran to the Prophet Muhammad.

The second, Eid al-Adha, generally considered the holier of the two eid festivals, takes place about two months after Eid al-Fitr at the end of the annual hajj pilgrimage to Mecca.

The dates of both holidays change every year, as they are based on the Islamic lunar calendar, which is about 11 days shorter than the Western 365-day Gregorian calendar.
Imam Mohammad Yasser of Iligan City, Lanao del Norte, said, ""Because Ibrahim was allowed to sacrifice a ram instead of his son, Eid al-Adha is traditionally celebrated on its first day, by those with means to do so, with the symbolic sacrifice of a lamb, goat, cow, camel or other animal that is then divided and shared equally among family, friends and the needy.""

Meanwhile, Sheik Malo Manonggiring, acting director of the Bureau of Pilgrimage and Endowment of the National Commission on Muslim Filipinos, said the hajj is an annual religious pilgrimage to Mecca undertaken each year by 2 million to 3 million people.

This year, the hajj happens from approximately July 17 to 22, 2021.

Umrah, on the other hand, is a pilgrimage that can be completed at any time of the year.

Because of continuing Covid-19 concerns, the Saudi Ministry of Hajj and Umrah announced on June 12 that only 60,000 residents and citizens of Saudi Arabia will be permitted to perform the hajj.

The Saudi Arabian government has also announced a series of entry restrictions, including for religious travel.

The process for performing the umrah has changed significantly as a result of the pandemic, and all travelers have been advised to make sure to read through all requirements before booking travel, Manonggiring said.

The Ministry of Hajj and Umrah requires certain mobile applications to be downloaded and used to request issuance of permits for scheduled times to enter holy sites.

Requests from a total of 7,054 registered Muslim Filipinos intending to do the hajj were disapproved because of surges in coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) cases in the Philippines and other countries, Manonggiring said.",REAL

BACOLOD CITY: Over the weekend, Negros Occidental Gov. Eugenio Jose Lacson urged Negrenses to remain calm after the Department of Health (DoH) confirmed two cases of the Delta Covid-19 variant in Western Visayas.

The governor appealed for Negrenses to cooperate by wearing face masks and face shields as well as observing physical distancing.

He also urged residents of the province, especially those under the A2 category (senior citizens), to get and complete their vaccination.

Lacson said they have already been advised by the DoH in Western Visayas to prepare over the possible entry of the Delta variant, which was first detected in India.

He added that the country's health-care system may face difficulties if the Delta variant spreads beyond the control of health authorities just like what happened in India and this month in Indonesia.
The governor said he hopes that the province will be able to achieve herd immunity at the soonest possible time in order to thwart the spread of the Delta variant.

He called on the national government to immediately open the vaccination program for all categories.
Last week, two people from Antique were confirmed to have been infected with the Delta variant.

Later, one of the patients died from the illness while the other managed to recover.
The DoH is still conducting an investigation as to how the two people got infected with the Delta variant even though the two did not have any travel history.",REAL

NLEX Corp. is moving to fast-track the simultaneous rehabilitations of NLEX bridges in Meycauayan and Bigaa, both in the province of Bulacan, as it targets substantial completion by August 16 or a month ahead of its original completion date of Sept. 15, 2021.

J. Luigi Bautista, president and general manager of NLEX Corp., said the tollway company and its contractor were working together to find ways to speed up the work and complete the project for the benefit of the public.

""We have reached a significant breakthrough in our discussions with our contractor. So, we can finish ahead of schedule and provide motorists with safer and more convenient travel before the 'ber' months begin. Barring any unforeseen events, the accelerated completion date of Bigaa Bridge is August 11 instead of August 31, and the substantial completion date for Meycauayan [Bridge] is August 16 instead of September 15,"" Bautista added.

Rehabilitation work on the southbound portion of Meycauayan bridge has been finished and the repairs on the northbound side of the bridge started on Sunday, July 18.

Meanwhile, work on the northbound segment of the Bigaa bridge is steadily progressing.
NLEX Corp. has implemented new traffic management measures to ease traffic delays while the Meycauayan bridge rehabilitation is ongoing.

The corporation teamed up with the Department of Public Works and Highways to temporarily open the two-lane service road in Meycauayan in order that motorists with light vehicles could use it as a detour.
Last April, the tollway company started the rehabilitation of the two bridges, involving the replacement of girders and slabs to strengthen the structures and improve its lifespan.

These bridges are seen as vital in supporting safe, reliable and efficient movement of people and goods between the metro and the provinces in the north.

A Calgary, Alberta, animal health technology company, Sylvester.ai, has developed an app called Tably that uses the phone's camera to tell whether a feline is feeling pain.

The app looks at ear and head position, eye-narrowing, muzzle tension, and how whiskers change, to detect distress. A 2019 study published in peer-reviewed journal Scientific Reports found that the so-called 'feline grimace scale,' or FGS, is a valid and reliable tool for acute pain assessment in cats.

Previously, people creating new accounts were asked to chose between public or private accounts during the sign-up process.

Some Facebook posts state that COVID-19 is not a new disease, false allegations regarding cattle or canine Coronavirus spread through Twitter and misleading statements on the safety of protein consumption confuse producers and consumers. Together with several health and economic challenges, the COVID-19 pandemic brought misinformation and confusion around the globe. Against the wave of speculations and fake news, scientific facts matter: the strains of Coronavirus affecting animals differ from the new virus strain currently affecting humans.
While there is a lot of ongoing research in order to determine whether livestock might experience any kind of minor infections or even carry the virus mutation responsible for COVID-19, to date, there is no such evidence. This is good news to both livestock producers and consumers – not only their animals remain safe, but meat, milk and eggs are safe for human consumption as well.

A lot of conceptual confusion arouse due to the nature of Coronaviridae, which is a large family of viruses with four genera. Looking at the poultry segment as an example, Coronavirus is an old acquaintance. For many years, avian Coronavirus Infectious Bronchitis (IBV) has been challenging producers and veterinarians. However, the virus responsible for this disease is not the same that causes COVID-19.
 

“The Coronavirus family is divided in four groups: Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta. The one affecting poultry is a Gammacoronavirus, while a Betacoronavirus is responsible for COVID-19. It is important to highlight that the Gammacoronavirus affecting poultry cannot infect humans. In the same way, Covid-19, as a Betacoronavirus, cannot infect chickens,” explains Stephane Lemiere, Head of Avian Technical.
A broad variety of virus
In other words, the term Coronavirus refers to a broad group of viruses that circulate in nature. That variety became a fertile ground for rumors that brought an extra challenge: speculation, misinformation and fake news. False information circulated in different social media networks, in different languages, claiming that the novel Coronavirus was not a new disease. Photos of vials of Coronavirus vaccines for animals were also published as “evidence”.

These claims make no sense. It must be noted that the actual name of the virus that causes COVID-19 is SARS-CoV-2, whereas the Coronavirus for which a cattle vaccine is available is called BCV or BCoV; and the one affecting dogs is the CCV or CRCoV, which wouldn’t work across species either.

“The same logic applies to poultry.

The United Kingdom and WHO collaborate to manage the infodemic

Acting on the wrong information can kill. In the first 3 months of 2020, nearly 6 000 people around the globe were hospitalized because of coronavirus misinformation, recent research suggests. During this period, researchers say at least 800 people may have died due to misinformation related to COVID-19*.

At its extreme, death can be the tragic outcome of what the World Health Organization has termed the infodemic, an overabundance of information — some accurate, some not — that spreads alongside a disease outbreak. False information runs the gamut, from discrediting the threat of COVID-19 to conspiracy theories that vaccines could alter human DNA.

Though they aren’t new, in our digital age infodemics spread like wildfire. They create a breeding ground for uncertainty. Uncertainty in turn fuels skepticism and distrust, which is the perfect environment for fear, anxiety, finger-pointing, stigma, violent aggression and dismissal of proven public health measures — which can lead to loss of life.

To try to control the COVID-19 infodemic, WHO has teamed up with the United Kingdom Government to create and distribute content to combat the spread of misinformation through a series of communication campaigns. This was one of several initiatives to combat misinformation taken by WHO on its own and with partners since the start of the COVID-19 outbreak.

Stop the Spread

‘Stop the Spread’ rolled out on BBC World television, website and apps during May and June 2020. It aimed to raise the public’s awareness of the volume of misinformation around COVID-19 and encourage people to double check information, therefore limiting the damage and spread of false information.",FAKE

YOU CAN HELP BREAK THE FAKE NEWS CHAIN! Unless the information comes directly from an official source, take it with a grain of salt.

1. Establish whether you have indeed come across fake information.

Be mindful – fake news will often tell you what you want to hear with clickbait headlines.
Look around – is the website trustworthy? Check the website’s about page, mission and contact info.
Check the sources – is any other news source reporting on the same thing? How many sources does the story quote?
Photo search – is the news you are reading accompanied by a photo that strikes you as out of context? Run an online search, it might be your clue towards figuring out that this is an example of misinformation.
Check the date – some news outlets re-publish old posts or promote old news as current stories. Check the publication date of the article and check if the timeline it refers to makes sense.
Turn to the experts – go to reputable websites, such as the World Health Organization, your national health authority and the European Commission. Is the information also available there?
2. If you have come across fake information, do not engage with it. Do not comment and do not share further. Doing so would just help make the post more popular.

3. If it was shared on social media, report the post to the platform. If you know the person who shared the fake news, send them a private message and tell them that the information they posted is likely false. Send them these tips so they understand the risks.

4. Contribute to sharing official information. Share updates from trustworthy, official websites that report on COVID-19.",FAKE

In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has come to dominate the media, both domestically and abroad. Alongside increased attention on the pandemic, has come the viral spread of COVID-19 fake news online.

Many of these stories, as tantalising as they are, are patently false.

In reality, it was not the US government that created the virus. And it wasn’t the Chinese government either. And no, 5G has nothing to do with it whatsoever.

If you look for quick remedies, don’t get your hopes up. It turns out sipping water every 15 minutes does not help. Nor does receiving blessings through the TV screen. And to cocaine, just say no.

Misinformation is something that we might expect for any major event that captures people’s imagination, but in the case of COVID-19, the spread of fake news offers unique challenges and dangers to the public.

My research focuses on how innovation and new technologies (like social media, artificial intelligence, virtual reality) interact with consumer behaviour.

Unfortunately, these otherwise useful technologies can end up being abused. This is clearly the case with COVID-19 fake news on social media.

GOOD AND BAD INTENTIONS

There are two major types of false information.

The first is disinformation, which is spread intentionally by people in bad faith. In the case of COVID-19, there has been disinformation blaming racial groups, illegal immigrants and even governments for the spread of the virus.

It appears certain political groups and state agents may wish to propagate chaos for the sake of political gains.

The other kind of fake news is misinformation, which is spread innocently despite being incorrect.

Examples of COVID-19 misinformation include misconstrued understandings of the disease, wishful thinking about false remedies and fanciful implications drawn on how the spread of the virus will play out.

Some of it has been mere speculation among otherwise well-meaning people who then spread their opinion as fact.",FAKE

To date, more than 4.5 million people around the world have been infected with the deadly COVID-19 virus, a type of coronavirus related to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States (US), the virus is said to spread mainly from person to person, through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. The droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are in close proximity with the infected person or possibly be inhaled into the lungs. 

To be anxious and paranoid is common when facing a pandemic, especially one that has affected the global economy and is predicted to cause a recession soon. Nevertheless, misinformation on social media and fake chain messages on popular communications app, WhatsApp, have further fuelled panic among members of the public. Governments and authorities have urged citizens to check the authenticity of news stories before sharing them with friends and loved ones. 

Just last month, it was reported that a new decree took effect in Vietnam whereby fines for spreading fake news or rumours on social media was implemented. A fine of VND10 to VND20 million (US$426 - US$853) will be imposed on those who use social media to share false, untruthful, distorted or slanderous information. The new decree was introduced amid the rapid spread of comments online about COVID-19 in the country. Some other nations have also gone the extra mile by arresting those who spread false news about the virus. In early February, local police and the Malaysian Communication and Multimedia Commission (MCMC) detained a total of 12 people in the country for posting fake news about the novel coronavirus. Whereas in the Philippines, 32 people were charged with disseminating false information regarding the virus back in April.

Metro Manila (CNN Philippines, July 28) — Two activists in the province of Albay did not even get to finish their protest art for the final State of the Nation Address before they were killed by the police.

Jemar Palero of the Organisasyon ng mga Magsasaka sa Albay and Marlon Naperi of the Albay People's Organization were shot by the police early Monday morning while they were painting graffiti on the Banao Bridge along Maharlika Highway.

The words ""DUTERTE IBAGS"" — meant to say ""DUTERTE IBAGSAK"" — were sprayed on the beams.

PMaj. Joseph Jarabejo of Guinobatan Municipal Police Station told news organization Bicol.PH that the two men drew their firearms when authorities on board a patrol car approached them. He also said the police had ""no choice"" but to retaliate.

Rights groups are not buying the statement of the police that the two activists drew fire. Karapatan said the two activists were unarmed.

Metro Manila (CNN Philippines, July 28) — COVID-19 research watchdog OCTA has urged the national government to implement a hard lockdown in Metro Manila before coronavirus cases spike further.

OCTA Research fellow Dr. Guido David on Wednesday said the surge in the capital region is only in its early stages and can still be managed.

Comparing it to the surges in February 2021 and July 2020, Guido said lockdowns should be enforced immediately to turn the tide.

He said the government enforced a lockdown last year when cases were just hovering around 2,000 so fixing it only took two weeks of modified enhanced community quarantine.

On the other hand, the lockdown earlier this year took two months because the government waited for cases to soar to 4,000.

The group said the best strategy is a ""go early, go hard"" lockdown.

""If we wait too long, next week, it may not be the same case anymore,"" David told CNN Philippines

""A one-week timeout now compared to maybe to a 3-4 weeks timeout later, that's a big difference in terms of the impact on the economy and on livelihood,"" he explained.

OCTA Professor Ranjit Rye earlier said, ""Kung maaga tayong mag-i-enforce ng circuit breaking restrictions, sa tingin namin sa OCTA mas mainam iyon. Maaga at maingat.""

[Translation: OCTA believes it will be better if we enforce circuit breaking restrictions early on. Early and cautious.]

OCTA said the reproduction rate in the National Capital Region is at 1.33 and it is not decreasing.

The region is recording an average of 1,000 COVID-19 infections daily, but OCTA predicts it can double in two weeks.

David added that Metro Manila will find it hard to manage an exponential increase in cases since it's a densely populated region.

Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said in a television interview on Wednesday that the healthcare capacity in NCR remains at ""moderate risk.""

""That's of course a concern because if we reached 2,000 cases, we will be reaching close to the surge capacity of the region,"" David said.

""That means at that point, we'll start becoming more exponential because it will exceed the surge capacity,"" the researcher also said.

(CNN) — More than 14 years after they were first introduced, iPhones are still very much in demand.

Apple on Tuesday announced a massive earnings beat for the three months ended June 26, thanks to a nearly 50% year-over-year jump in iPhone sales to $39.6 billion. The company posted total quarterly revenue increased 36% to $81.4 billion — a record for the June quarter and nearly $8 billion above analyst expectations.

""This quarter, our teams built on a period of unmatched innovation by sharing powerful new products with our users, at a time when using technology to connect people everywhere has never been more important,"" Apple CEO Tim Cook said in a statement.

The June quarter is typically Apple's slowest time of year and some analysts had worried, leading up to the report, that the company would face tough year-over-year comparisons for hardware sales because the pandemic was driving strong demand for Macs and iPads this time last year. Others were concerned that the global chip shortage could cause a slowdown in sales of Apple products.

But Apple's results suggest it's still going strong even as the Covid-19 conditions have improved in many parts of the world. The company posted double-digit revenue growth in each of its product categories.

During the quarter, Apple announced a redesigned iMac and new iPad Pro, both made with Apple's in-house M1 chip. Although the new iMac design was controversial, Cook said during Tuesday's earnings call that the new product helped push Mac revenue to a June quarter record. CFO Luca Maestri added that the last four quarters have been the best ever for Mac sales, thanks to the success of the M1 chip.

""Apple reported another solid quarter, highlighting the durability of the company's brand,"" Jesse Cohen, senior analyst at Investing.com, said in an email. ""IPhones were the biggest driver of growth, suggesting consumers are continuing to upgrade to 5G.""

Apple may also have been helped by a greater portion of its customers opting to buy the higher-end versions of the iPhone 12, Apple's first-ever 5G phone that was introduced last fall.

Services, an area of Apple's business that's become increasingly important in recent years, also posted strong growth during the quarter. With nearly $17.5 billion in quarterly sales, services generated the second highest revenue of any product category behind the iPhone.

On Tuesday's earnings call, Apple executives declined to provide revenue guidance for the September quarter, but said they expect a slower revenue growth rate than during the June quarter, due to foreign exchange impacts and supply constraints affecting iPhone and iPad. Maestri also said the year-over-year growth rate for services would likely slow after the June quarter rate benefited from a comparison to last year's dip in services sales because of the pandemic.",REAL

(CNN) — The economic outlook for rich countries is getting better while developing economies are falling behind.

That's according to the latest forecast from the International Monetary Fund. The organization on Tuesday confirmed its prediction that the global economy will expand by 6% this year. But while growth estimates for countries like the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada have improved since the IMF's previous report in April, expectations for India and countries in southeast Asia have dropped back.

The IMF said the divide largely comes down to differences in vaccination rates.

""Vaccine access has emerged as the principal fault line along which the global recovery splits into two blocs: those that can look forward to further normalization of activity later this year (almost all advanced economies) and those that will still face resurgent infections and rising Covid death tolls,"" the group said in its report.

Close to 40% of the population in advanced economies is fully vaccinated, according to the IMF. In emerging market economies, the vaccination rate is 11%, while low-income countries lag even further behind.

The IMF now predicts that the US economy will grow by 7% this year, 0.6 percentage points higher than in its previous forecast. The United Kingdom is also expected to expand output by 7%, an upward revision of 1.7 percentage points. The 19 countries that use the euro are set to experience 4.6% growth, a 0.2 percentage boost, while Canada is on track for 6.3% growth, a 1.3 percentage point upgrade.

Meanwhile, China is set to log growth of 8.1%, a slight downward revision amid fears that its recovery could be losing steam. Projections for economic growth in India received a sizable downgrade following a recent wave of Covid-19 infections. The country's economy is now expected to grow by 9.5% this year, compared to a 12.5% projection in April.

""Faster-than-expected vaccination rates and return to normalcy have led to upgrades, while lack of access to vaccines and renewed waves of Covid-19 cases in some countries, notably India, have led to downgrades,"" IMF chief economist Gita Gopinath said in a blog post.

The IMF cautioned that different levels of policy support from governments could exacerbate the split.

""We are seeing continued sizable fiscal support in advanced economies with $4.6 trillion of announced pandemic-related measures available in 2021 and beyond,"" Gopinath said. ""On the other hand, in emerging market and developing economies most measures expired in 2020 and they are looking to rebuild fiscal buffers. Some emerging markets like Brazil, Hungary, Mexico, Russia and Turkey have also begun raising monetary policy rates to head off upward price pressures.""",REAL

(CNN) — The political organization cofounded by NBA superstar LeBron James launched a new campaign Monday to promote voting rights and criminal justice reform.

The campaign, ""Protect Our People,"" is being spearheaded by James' More Than a Vote, a voting rights organization; and Uninterrupted, an athlete empowerment brand.

""We can't lose the momentum of last summer,"" reads a tweet from Uninterrupted. ""We need real solutions to stop police brutality.""

This campaign comes on the heels of another that the group started in March named ""Protect Our Power,"" which focuses on fighting voter suppression across the country. More Than A Vote was formed last year after the killings of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor to leverage the collective voices of athletes in the fight against systemic racism, reads the organization's press release.

""More Than A Vote is stepping up its criminal justice reform work because 2020 proved that when athletes speak out about the issues that matter to them, people listen,"" spokesman Michael Tyler said in a press release. ""The Protect Our People campaign will replicate the successful model of harnessing athlete activism in electoral politics and apply it to the ongoing fight to move public opinion and change criminal justice policies that regularly victimize Black communities.""

The campaign had a soft launch in May on the anniversary of Floyd's death. On Monday, it officially kicked off with a segment of HBO's ""The Shop,"" a show produced by James and business partner Maverick Carter. HBO is also part of CNN's parent company, Warner Media.

The segment featured conversations between Art Acevedo, chief of the Miami Police Department; Natasha Cloud, WNBA champion; Ben Crump, national civil rights attorney; Philonise Floyd, brother of George Floyd; Jemele Hill, journalist; and Meek Mill, rapper. The group discussed issues with the criminal justice system and policing policies.

""We need systemic change that holds the police accountable,"" reads a tweet from Uninterrupted. ""The George Floyd Justice in Policing Act won't solve everything -- but it's a first step.""

(CNN) — Lauren Salzman was once a high-ranking leader of the purported self-help group Nxivm and a loyal member of founder Keith Raniere's inner circle.

But ahead of her sentencing Wednesday in Brooklyn, she shared in court documents why she eventually cooperated with the government and testified against him.

In 2019, Salzman pleaded guilty to racketeering and racketeering conspiracy charges. She could face seven to nine years in prison, but prosecutors recommended less time, writing to US District Judge Nicholas Garaufis that her cooperation was ""extraordinary"" and that her testimony ""substantially contributed"" to the prosecution of Raniere.

He was sentenced to 120 years in prison after being convicted of racketeering, sex trafficking, sexual eploitation of a child, human trafficking and more in 2019.

Garaufis scalled Raniere's crimes ""cruel, perverse and extremely serious.""

Salzman's attorneys point out that she was the first co-defendant to cooperate and the only one to testify. They say she spent ""countless"" hours explaining how the criminal enterprise worked to prosecutors. Her attorneys asked that she receive no prison time.

During her testimony, Salzman spoke about becoming part of a secretive group within Nxivm called DOS. It was touted as a ""women's empowerment group"" and its existence was kept secret, enforced by the demand that the women who joined share ""collateral"" with its leaders -- damaging documents such as explicit nude photos and letters. She said women were directed to have sex with Raniere, directed to send sexually explicit photos to him and were coerced to get brands with his initials on them, symbolizing a lifetime vow.

One witness testified about how Salzman had been part of a group who kept her in a room for two years by withholding her immigration and identification documents, despite her begging to leave.

Salzman's journey into Nxvim, what finally pushed her to plead guilty and testify against her longtime lover, and how she continues to grapple with her role are detailed in documents filed before her sentencing. They include a letter from Salzman apologizing to victims.

""I wish I could go back. I wish I could take my participation back. I wish I had been stronger and seen things sooner,"" Salzman wrote to the court.",REAL

CNN) — Joey Jordison, a founder of the heavy metal band Slipknot, has died, his family announced in a statement provided Tuesday to CNN.

He was 46.

""We are heartbroken to share the news that Joey Jordison, prolific drummer, musician and artist passed away peacefully in his sleep on July 26th, 2021,"" the family said. ""Joey's death has left us with empty hearts and feelings of indescribable sorrow.""

Legendary band Metallica paid tribute to Jordison on their official Facebook page with a photo of him on stage and the caption ""R.I.P. brother.""

Jordison served as a drummer for Slipknot, which he helped create in Des Moines, Iowa, in 1995.

The masked band burst onto the music scene with a self-titled album in 1999.

They enjoyed much success, including the selling of millions of records worldwide and the formation of the Knotfest music festival in 2012.

There were also controversies surrounding some of their violent lyrics. And founding bassist Paul Gray overdosed at the age of 38.

In 2013, it was announced that Jordison and the band would be parting ways.

Three years later the musician revealed to Metal Hammer that he had been diagnosed with a rare disease of the nervous system and said he was hurt after the band fired him via email.

""No band meeting? None,"" Jordison told the publication. ""Anything from management? No, nothing.""

He also said he was angered that some people thought his ailment may have been connected to substance abuse, but said he loved his bandmates and was open to rejoining them.

Jordison also launched other bands Scar the Martyr, Vimic and Sinsaenum.

In the family's statement released Tuesday they wrote ""To those that knew Joey, understood his quick wit, his gentle personality, giant heart and his love for all things family and music.""

(CNN) — This time last year, Google was starting to feel the early pandemic slump as large parts of the global economy shut down. On Tuesday, the company showed just how far it's come since.

Google's parent company Alphabet reported revenue of $61.9 billion for the quarter ended June 30, a staggering 62% jump from the same quarter last year and significantly higher than analysts had expected. The company's profits more than doubled to $18.5 billion.

Alphabet's stock rose 3% in after-hours trading Tuesday following the earnings report.

Much of that growth was driven by a rebound in Google's core advertising business, which posted revenue of $50.4 billion — a 69% increase from the year prior. Ad revenue from the company's video platform YouTube surged 84% to $7 billion.

Google's ongoing efforts to diversity its business beyond online advertising also appear to be bearing fruit.

Alphabet and Google CEO Sundar Pichai hailed the company's investments in artificial intelligence and its rapidly growing cloud business, the latter of which shrunk its quarterly losses from $1.4 billion to $591 million compared to the same period last year. Google Cloud revenue surged 54% to $4.6 billion.

""In Q2, there was a rising tide of online activity in many parts of the world, and we're proud that our services helped so many consumers and businesses,"" Pichai said in a statement. ""Our long-term investments in AI and Google Cloud are helping us drive significant improvements in everyone's digital experience.""

Even as he touted Google's gangbusters growth and recovery, Pichai kicked off a conference call to discuss the results with a reminder that the pandemic isn't over yet.

(CNN) — Facebook on Tuesday reaffirmed its intention to build an Instagram for kids under 13, despite pressure from lawmakers to back down on the plan, while simultaneously announcing new updates to address concerns about the safety of younger users on its platforms.

In a blog post, the company said it is developing ""a new Instagram experience for tweens"" managed by parents and guardians as part of its efforts to ""reduce the incentive for people under the age of 13 to lie about their age.""

""The reality is that they're already online, and with no foolproof way to stop people from misrepresenting their age, we want to build experiences designed specifically for them, managed by parents and guardians,"" the post said.

In March, BuzzFeed News obtained an internal Instagram memo stating the company had ""identified youth work as a priority"" and was planning to build a version specifically intended for kids.

In May, 44 attorneys general signed a letter addressed to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, urging him to scrap plans for an Instagram intended for younger users, citing mental health and privacy concerns. The letter came less than a month after child safety groups and Congress expressed similar concerns.

Facebook's plan to continue with the development of an Instagram for kids, reportedly called Instagram Youth, was tucked into an announcement around adding more safety measures to the popular photo-sharing platform. This includes setting the accounts of users under age 16 to private by default to cut down on unwanted interactions with strangers and limiting how advertisers target the demographic.

Marketers can no longer reach young users based on their interests or activity on Facebook, Instagram and Messenger. They can, however, still use age, gender or location for targeted ads.

Facebook also said it plans to use artificial intelligence to verify the age of its users and remove underage accounts. For example, the tool would allow it to search for keywords in Instagram posts, such as a happy birthday message, and cross reference it with the user's birth date registered on Facebook.",REAL

https://cnnphilippines.com/business/2021/7/28/Tesla-stocks-Wall-Street-forecasts.html???

(CNN) — The last time Tesla reported quarterly earnings this far above Wall Street expectations, in October of 2019, it started the stock on one of the most incredible bull runs ever.

Not this time.

Shares of Tesla were down 3% in early afternoon trading Tuesday, despite a strong second quarter that blew away Wall Street forecasts for both earnings and revenue. It's a sign that getting the market's biggest winner of 2020 back on track won't be easy.

Tesla's record $1.1 billion in net income in Q2 was more than twice the previous high it hit in the prior quarter and more than 10 times its entire 2020 net profit. Adjusted earnings of $1.6 billion and revenue of $12 billion both topped Wall Street forecasts by about 60%.

Problems, delays beyond the strong numbers
But this time investors are more focused on the problems that CEO Elon Musk and other Tesla executives discussed during a Monday evening conference call.

The company has once again pushed back the debut of its Cybertruck pickup and its semi-tractor heavy duty truck, this time into 2022, due mostly to battery shortages. Company leaders also discussed unexpected problems with the development of a promised ""4680"" battery that is supposed to provide a breakthrough in both battery costs and the distance a vehicle can travel on a single charge. They gave no time frame for when that battery will be available.

And Musk suggested that even though Tesla has started selling subscriptions for its full self-driving, or FSD, feature, the technology still isn't ready, even as he continued to promise it should be as soon as next year.

""We need to make full self-driving work in order for it to be a compelling value proposition,"" Musk said. ""Right now ... does it make sense for somebody to [pay for an] FSD subscription? I think it's debatable.""

These warnings on trucks, batteries and self-driving technology are a far more serious problem for Tesla and its shares than any bump they might get from one very good quarter, critics of the company say.

""Even though the earnings were good, they didn't in any way justify the multiples the shares are at,"" said analyst Gordon Johnson of GLJ Research, one of Tesla's harshest critics. ""Musk's grandiose promises are the reason for these multiples. To own or buy the stock, you have to believe it's in the lead in batteries and in the lead in full self-driving.

Metro Manila (CNN Philippines, July 28) — The Department of the Interior and Local Government is directing local government units to ensure that people are safe from health risks when they receive their COVID-19 shots amid continuous rainfall and flooding in many parts of Luzon.

In a statement, the DILG said it has issued a directive to local leaders to ensure that vaccination sites, including outside premises and queue areas are safe and convenient and have little to no exposure to rains, floods, and other hazards.

""The safety of everyone should be top of mind as we carry out our vaccination efforts and especially during this rainy season,” Interior Secretary Eduardo Año said.

This is also in line with the call of President Rodrigo Duterte to ensure ""more sane"" vaccination process amid the rainy weather and the threat of the Delta coronavirus variant.

Duterte issued the order following reports that people scheduled for vaccination, especially in Metro Manila, braved the monsoon rains and floods to get inoculated.

The DILG also reminded LGUs to make sure their vaccination hubs can accommodate the special needs of the elderly, persons with comorbidity, and those with disabilities.

They were also instructed to improve their scheduling and appointment system to prevent long lines.

Meanwhile, Undersecretary Jonathan Malaya said alternative vaccination sites are now being identified in the National Capital Region to address overcrowding and flooding in 28 sites.

To date, the government has administered some 17.5 million vaccine doses, wherein around 6.3 million individuals received both their shots.

(CNN) — To prevent further spread of the Delta variant, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention updated its mask guidance on Tuesday to recommend that fully vaccinated people wear masks indoors when in areas with ""substantial"" and ""high"" transmission of COVID-19, which includes nearly two-thirds of all US counties.

""In recent days I have seen new scientific data from recent outbreak investigations showing that the Delta variant behaves uniquely differently from past strains of the virus that cause COVID-19,"" CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky told a media briefing on Tuesday.

""This new science is worrisome and unfortunately warrants an update to our recommendations,"" she said. ""This is not a decision that we or CDC has made lightly.""

New unpublished data showing that vaccinated people infected with the Delta coronavirus variant can have as much virus as those who are unvaccinated is the primary driver for the CDC's latest mask guidance change, a source involved with the decision process told CNN. Overall, vaccinated people still play a small role in transmission and breakthrough infections are rare.

In addition, the source noted two other factors that led to this decision: the prevalence of the Delta variant and low vaccine uptake.

When the CDC previously revised its guidance on May 13 for vaccinated people to unmask, Delta only represented 1% of reported infections. Now, according to the CDC, it represents at least 83% of cases.

The source also noted that the country's overall level of vaccination is lower than what was initially expected and that most transmission is happening in areas with vaccination levels below 40% of the population.

""When you get information about risks and how to mitigate risks, there's a public health obligation to let people know about it,"" a senior administration official said.

(CNN) — Add it to your fall 2021 back to school shopping list: Buy more masks.

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is expected to recommend that everyone in K-12 schools wear a mask, regardless of their vaccination status, as it updates its masking guidelines in response to the more transmissible Delta variant, according to an administration health official.

We know that little humans pull and tug at the masks constantly, and kids don't just stop there. They let the tops fall beneath their noses and sometimes even yank the things down below their mouths, just because they can.

Despite all these protests from children in countries where face coverings aren't already part of the culture, masks are a must this fall, according to the CDC.

The CDC has already recommended that all kids over the age of 2 wear face coverings in indoor public places to help reduce the spread of Covid-19.

That means that now is the time to get kids back on board with the reality of masks in schools. We know kids around the world who already know how to wear masks — it's simply part of their routine when they leave the house.

How do you get your child there? We've asked doctors, psychologists and parents for their best strategies for getting little ones to wear face coverings and keep them on. Here are their top five suggestions.

Know your child
Every child is different, which means it behooves parents to take the time to think about how each of their children may relate to face coverings.

""It's not a one-size-fits-all kind of thing,"" said Jennifer Sciolla, senior director of child and family services at Nemours Alfred I. duPont Hospital for Children in Wilmington, Delaware. ""You always want to make that time and space in the beginning for parents to consider their child.""

Parents should ask themselves a series of questions before even trying to formulate a strategy to get kids to wear face coverings, Sciolla suggested.

Among them: What is important to my child? How does my child understand information? How aware of the outside world is my child? To what extent might a mask or the possibility of a mask give my child anxiety?

Part of the issue is age. Toddlers may be frightened to see others in masks because they lack the ability to recognize and read faces that kids develop by adolescence, research has indicated.",REAL

Metro Manila (CNN Philippines, July 28) — The Metro Manila Council said it is ready to implement again enhanced community quarantine in the region amid threats posed by the Delta coronavirus variant.

MMC chair Edwin Olivarez, however, pointed out that the next quarantine classification for the capital will still depend on the recommendations of health experts, data, and protocols to be implemented by local chief executives in their jurisdictions.

This comes after President Rodrigo Duterte said in his State of the Nation Address the possibility of imposing strict quarantine restrictions to curb the spread of the more transmissible Delta variant.

The council is expected to discuss the matter on Wednesday.

The National Capital Region was last placed under ECQ early this year due to a spike in the number of infections, which was driven by the Alpha and Beta variants.

Speaking as Parañaque City mayor, Olivarez said the currently implemented general community quarantine with heightened restrictions is enough so far.

San Juan City Mayor Francis Zamora shared the same sentiment, noting that the Delta variant situation is still under control.

Both mayors also said that they still have the option to implement granular lockdowns to address a possible transmission of the virus.

So far, the country has recorded 119 Delta variant cases.

Other countries that are facing a surge in cases driven by the feared variant have implemented lockdowns to control its spread.

In the Philippines, health experts are recommending stricter protocols to prevent the same scenario from happening, but business leaders are against this because of its economic impact.

(CNN) — US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin said Tuesday that China's claims and actions in the Indo-Pacific threaten the sovereignty of nations around the region while Washington is committed to building partnerships that guarantee the vital interest of all nations.

""Beijing's claim to the vast majority of the South China Sea has no basis in international law. That assertion treads on the sovereignty of states in the region,"" Austin said in a speech to the International Institute for Strategic Studies in Singapore.

China claims almost all of the 1.3-million-square-mile South China Sea as its sovereign territory, despite much of those claims running against international law.

The US defense chief said China's intransigence extended beyond the South China Sea.

""Beijing's unwillingness to resolve disputes peacefully and respect the rule of law isn't just occurring on the water. We have also seen aggression against India, destabilizing military activity and other forms of coercion against the people of Taiwan, and genocide and crimes against humanity against Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang,"" Austin said

""We will not flinch when our interests are threatened. Yet we do not seek confrontation,"" he said.

""Let me be clear: ... I am committed to pursuing a constructive, stable relationship with China,"" he said.

But six months into the Biden administration, relations between Washington and Beijing, which have worsened in recent years, are rockier than ever.

(CNN) — The US could see nearly four times the current rate of COVID-19 cases in the next four to six weeks as the Delta variant spreads and the population hits a wall on vaccinations, a former director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told CNN.

That warning comes as the CDC is expected to change its masking guidance Tuesday -- by recommending that vaccinated people in certain parts of the country resume wearing masks, and that everyone in K-12 schools wear masks regardless of vaccination status -- according to sources familiar with the decisions.

""We're heading into a rough time. It's likely, if our trajectory is similar to that in the United Kingdom, that we could see as many as 200,000 cases a day,"" Dr. Tom Frieden said Monday, adding the US likely won't see the ""horrific death tolls"" of earlier in the pandemic thanks to the number of vulnerable people who are vaccinated.

But, he said, ""You will see a steady increase in deaths, and these are preventable deaths.""

Cases have jumped as the Delta variant gained in prominence. Every state saw more COVID-19 cases reported in the past week than the week previous, according to Johns Hopkins University data.

The US averaged more than 57,300 new daily cases over the last week -- an average that's generally risen since the country hit a 2021 low of 11,351 daily on June 22, according to Johns Hopkins University data.

The last time more than 200,000 US cases were reported in a day was in January, according to Johns Hopkins.

The Delta variant is believed to be more transmissible than other strains -- so much so, Frieden said, that it is essentially finding people who are unvaccinated.

And much of the country remains unvaccinated, despite incentive programs and urging from health experts. Only 49.1% of the US population is fully vaccinated, according to the CDC. Daily vaccination rates are slowing, with only about two thirds of the eligible population having received at least one dose, the CDC said.",REAL

(CNN) — Walmart will pay for full college tuition and book costs at some schools for its US workers, the latest effort by the largest private employer in the country to sweeten its benefits as it seeks to attract and retain talent in a tight job market.

The program includes 10 academic partners ranging from the University of Arizona to Southern New Hampshire University. Participants must remain part-time or full-time employees at Walmart to be eligible.

The company said Tuesday that it will drop a previous $1 a day fee paid by Walmart and Sam's Club workers who want to earn a degree and also begin covering the costs of their books. Around 28,000 workers participate in the program, which Walmart began in 2018. Walmart has around 1.5 million workers.

""We feel that eliminating the dollar a day investment removes the financial barriers to enrollment, and it will increase access,"" Lorraine Stomski, senior vice president of learning and leadership at Walmart, said on a call with reporters Tuesday.

Walmart also said it was adding four new academic partners, bringing the total to 10, and offering more degree and certificate options in areas like business administration, supply chain and cybersecurity.

Walmart has incentive to expand the program. Employees who have participated in the program are twice as likely to get promoted and are retained at a ""significantly higher rate"" than other workers, Stomski said.

The move comes as retailers around the country face challenges hiring employees to staff stores and warehouses.

In May, there were 974,000 unfilled jobs in the retail industry, according to the latest data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Walmart earlier this year raised wages for 425,000 US workers to at least $13 an hour. Walmart's minimum wage is $11 an hour, below competitors such as Amazon and Target's $15 starting rate.

Other retailers are also increasing wages, offering hiring and referral bonuses and expanding benefits as they hunt for workers.

""We are fighting the same virus but a virus that has become faster and better adapted to transmitting amongst us humans, that's the change,"" he said.

Maria van Kerkhove, WHO technical lead on COVID-19, said the Delta variant was the most easily spread so far, about 50% more transmissible than ancestral strains of SARS-CoV-2 that first emerged in China in late 2019.

A few countries had reported increased hospitalization rates, but higher rates of mortality had not been recorded from the Delta variant, she said.

JERUSALEM - Israeli President Isaac Herzog received a third shot of coronavirus vaccine on Friday, kicking off a campaign to give booster doses to people aged over 60 as part of efforts to slow the spread of the highly contagious Delta variant.

Herzog, 60, received a booster dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine at the Sheba Medical Center in Ramat Gan, near Tel Aviv.

He said he was proud to launch the booster vaccination initiative ""which is so vital to enable normal circumstances of life as much as possible in this very challenging pandemic"". Herzog's wife Michal also received a shot.

The couple were accompanied by Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, who urged the importance of booster shots in fighting the COVID-19 pandemic and pledged that Israel would share all the information it gleans from the public inoculation rollout.

""Israel is a pioneer in going ahead with the third dose for older people of the age of 60 and above. The fight against the COVID pandemic is a global fight. The only way we can defeat COVID is together,"" Bennett said.

The booster campaign, with shots administered by health maintenance organizations, will effectively turn Israel into a testing ground for a third dose before approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

On the eve of the booster rollout Bennett said Israel had already given 2,000 immunosuppressed people a third dose with no severe adverse events.

His government hopes that stepped up inoculation efforts will help avoid further costly lockdowns.

Israel was a world leader in the vaccination rollout, and around 57% of the 9.3 million population has been double-vaccinated, rising to 87% of people in their sixties and more than 90% of those over 70.

Hundreds of thousands of people in China were in coronavirus lockdown Friday as the country battled its worst outbreak in months, while the United States intensified vaccination efforts in the face of a Delta variant-fueled surge.

The World Health Organization has warned that the highly transmissible strain, first detected in India, could unleash more Covid-19 outbreaks in a high-risk area from Morocco to Pakistan where vaccination rates are low.

In China, a cluster of infections in Nanjing city linked to airport workers who cleaned a plane from Russia earlier this month had reached the capital Beijing and five provinces by Friday.

Hundreds of thousands of people have been locked down in Jiangsu province, of which Nanjing is the capital, while 41,000 came under stay-at-home orders in Beijing's Changping district.

At least 206 infections across China have been linked to the cluster, and the outbreak is geographically the largest in several months.

It challenges Beijing's aggressive containment efforts which have relied on mass testing, lockdowns and swift contact tracing.

The Delta variant is more transmissible than the pathogens that cause SARS, Ebola and smallpox, and as easily spread as chickenpox, according to an internal US Centers for Disease Control presentation reported by The Washington Post and The New York Times.

It has driven recent surges around the world, especially in the Asia-Pacific region.

The Philippines next week will send more than 13 million people in the national capital region back into lockdown because of a Delta-linked increase, the government said Friday.

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has described Delta to be as contagious as chickenpox and could cause severe illness, the New York Times reported, citing an internal CDC document.

WASHINGTON - America's latest coronavirus wave, driven by the hyper-contagious Delta variant, has left vaccinated people seething at the unvaccinated for prolonging the pandemic and ensuring the return of restrictions rather than the carefree summer they were promised.

""It's almost like they don't care about the rest of the world. They're being selfish and self-centered,"" Alethea Reed, a 58-year-old health care administrator in the capital Washington told AFP.

""As somebody who falls in a higher risk category, and has a spouse who falls in a very high risk category, it's really frustrating,"" said clinical social worker Anne Hamon, 64, adding she was upset she had not been able to convince her own brother to take the shot.

With the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) this week recommending that vaccinated people go back to masking across much of the country, the mood was hardening among those who believe their lives were being disrupted as a result of others' choices.",REAL

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has described the Delta variant of the coronavirus to be as contagious as chickenpox and could cause severe illness, the New York Times reported, citing an internal CDC document.

The variant was also more likely to break through protections afforded by the vaccines, the report said, adding that the agency's reverse course on masking guidelines for fully vaccinated Americans on Tuesday was based on this document.

However, CDC's figures show that the vaccines are highly effective in preventing serious illness, hospitalization and death in vaccinated people, the report said, citing experts.

New research showed the vaccinated people infected with the Delta variant carried tremendous amounts of the virus in the nose and throat, CDC Director Rochelle Walensky told the Times.

The Delta variant is more transmissible than the viruses that cause MERS, SARS, Ebola, the common cold, the seasonal flu and smallpox, the report said.

The immediate next step for the agency is to ""acknowledge the war has changed,"" the report cited the document as saying.

Base sa depinisyon ng World Health Organization, masasabing may community transmission na kung hindi na makita ang koneksiyon ng bawat kaso at mataas na ang bilang o kung marami na ang nagpopositibo sa test. 

Sa ngayon, nasa 216 samples ang nakukumpirma ng Philippine Genome Center na positibo sa Delta variant. Sa bilang, 8 ang pumanaw na, at may edad na 27 hanggang 78 anyos.

“The report we received indicated that they sought refuge at the Philippine Embassy in Damascus because of the abuses they received from their employers, not to mention the poor working conditions,” Undersecretary Sarah Lou Y. Arriola said.

The department also said it would be extending reintegration assistance to the five repatriates. 

Another six trafficking survivors from Syria were repatriated in February this year. Three others returned home in April. 

It was a Washington post report titled ""Sold into Syrian servitude, Filipina workers tell of abuse, rape and imprisonment,"" that first bared the plight of dozens of Filipino who women recruited to work in the United Arab Emirates but trafficked to Syria to serve as domestic workers without their consent.

The report details that the migrant workers were at times denied pay and suffered physical and sexual abuse at the hands of their employers.  

Also per the story, many women who escaped from their employers' homes fled to the Philippine Embassy in Damascus but ""were not greeted with the sanctuary they had hoped for.""

It recounted that victims described embassy personnel as strict, denying them breakfast for two weeks as a punishment for minor offenses, such as sneaking extra food from the kitchen. 

In response to the report, Foreign Affairs Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr. on January 26 said he would repatriate all the distressed workers seeking shelter at the Philippine Embassy in Damascus.

He also ordered the DFA to launch an inquiry into embassy personnel for the ""poor treatment"" of the victims who were under their care.

""We are holding to account those who perpetrated the crime of trafficking-in-persons against our kababayan. We also guarantee that the survivors will be given due assistance in the filing and prosecution of criminal complaints,” Arriola said.

GENEVA, Switzerland — The Delta variant of COVID-19 is a warning to the world to suppress the virus quickly before it mutates again into something even worse, the WHO said Friday.

The highly-transmissible variant, first detected in India, has now surfaced in 132 countries and territories, the World Health Organization said.

""Delta is a warning: it's a warning that the virus is evolving but it is also a call to action that we need to move now before more dangerous variants emerge,"" the WHO's emergencies director Michael Ryan told a press conference.

WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus added: ""So far, four variants of concern have emerged -- and there will be more as long as the virus continues to spread.""

Tedros said that on average, infections increased by 80% over the past four weeks in five of the six WHO regions.

Though Delta has shaken many countries, Ryan said proven measures to bring transmission under control still worked -- notably physical distancing, wearing masks, hand hygiene and avoiding long periods indoors in poorly ventilated, busy places.

WASHINGTON, United States — The Delta variant of the coronavirus is as contagious as chickenpox, probably causes more severe disease than past strains, and breakthrough cases in vaccinated individuals may be as transmissible as unvaccinated cases, according to a leaked US government document.

The internal slide presentation produced by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) stresses that ""the war has changed"" as a result of Delta.

It was first reported by The Washington Post and has been verified by AFP.

CDC director Rochelle Walenksy cited data from the presentation this week to justify a return to masks for vaccinated people in high-risk areas.

One of the biggest takeaways is the finding that breakthrough infections in vaccinated people are highly contagious, with the data coming from previous studies and a new analysis of an outbreak in Provincetown, Massachusetts.

Experts rely on a number called the cycle threshold (Ct) value to indicate how much virus an infected person harbors, with lower numbers indicating higher viral load.

In Provincetown, there was ""no difference in mean Ct values in vaccinated and unvaccinated cases,"" the slides said.

On Friday, the CDC published a preliminary report about the superspreading event, in which roughly three-quarters of people were vaccinated.

The outbreak related to July 4 festivities, with the latest number of people infected swelling to 900, according to local reports. 

But unlike previous mass outbreaks, hospitalizations are low -- only seven so far, according to news website MassLive, and so far no deaths.

""This is a key point which is part of the reason the CDC changed its guidance,"" Celine Gounder, an infectious diseases physician and professor at New York University, told AFP.

""It's not really so much for your own protection: as a vaccinated person if you have one of these breakthrough infections, you may have mild symptoms, you may have no symptoms, but based on what we're seeing here you could be contagious to other people.""

Accordingly, the CDC has changed its guidance to say vaccinated people need to test if they are exposed to the virus even if they don't have symptoms.

Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University, added that a point to note about the Provincetown outbreak is that it occurred in a setting where community transmission was low -- and as such, the CDC's new masking recommendation wouldn't have applied there.

""Moreover, public reporting around that outbreak investigation suggest(s) that exposures were likely at places like bars and house parties, where mask wearing would be unlikely,"" she told AFP.",REAL

MANILA, Philippines – Economic managers will revisit their goals after President Rodrigo Duterte approved a proposal to tighten restrictions in Metro Manila to slow down a new surge in infections believed to be fueled by the Delta variant.

The interagency Development Budget Coordination Committee (DBCC) will “review” this year’s economic targets once the second quarter gross domestic product data is out, Socioeconomic Planning Secretary Karl Kendrick Chua said in a Viber message on Friday, following the announcement of new lockdown measures.

As the country detects more cases of the highly contagious Delta variant, the National Capital Region will be put under enhanced community quarantine (ECQ) — the strictest lockdown there is — from August 6 to 20 to avert another deadly surge in infections that could overwhelm hospitals again.

But unlike the previous ECQ last March that covered the capital and four nearby urban areas, the new one would be limited to Metro Manila, in what seems to be an attempt to minimize economic damage. This time around, the government also granted businessmen’s request for ample time to prepare for the looming lockdown. Vaccinations will likewise continue.

Official economic data for the second quarter will not come out until August 10, but economic managers have indicated that GDP was likely back to growth territory already, not because the economy is mounting a convincing recovery but because the data would be distorted by low-base effects from last year’s pandemic-induced slump.",REAL

MANILA, Philippines (Update 2: 5:23 p.m.) — President Rodrigo Duterte decided to recall his termination of the decades-old Visiting Forces Agreement following his meeting with US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin Thursday night, Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana said.

Lorenzana made the announcement in a joint press briefing with Austin held Friday.

“On behalf of the US, let me thank President Duterte for his decision to fully restore the Visiting Forces Agreement,” US Defense Secretary Austin said. 

The abrogation of the Visiting Forces Agreement was announced in February 2020.

Among Duterte’s reasons for scrapping the military agreement was Sen. Ronald dela Rosa’s claim that his US Visa had been canceled.

https://www.philstar.com/business/2021/07/30/2116362/higher-food-fuel-prices-likely-drove-inflation-july

MANILA, Philippines — Higher fuel and food prices, compounded by a surge in power rates and a weak currency, likely stoked inflation in July, the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas said.

In a statement on Friday, the BSP said it expects inflation to settle between 3.9-4.7% in July. If the upper-end of the forecast range is realized, it would be faster than 4.1% annual reading recorded in June and would settle above the central bank’s 2-4% annual target.

State statisticians will report the official July inflation data on August 5.

Much of the price concerns are hinged on global petroleum prices staying elevated for the past month as easing lockdowns boost demand for oil, thereby pushing domestic fuel costs up. Because the Philippines is a net oil importer, the peso’s current weakness also added some upward price pressure. Energy department data showed local oil companies adjusted fuel prices four times this month, mostly increases.

At the same time, key food items also got more expensive this month, the BSP said, as heavy monsoon rains damage crops. Prices of meat, especially pork, also stay high as the local African swine fever outbreak remains uncontained, although authorities expect some easing of price pressures as pork supply from abroad arrives.

On top of that, power costs inched up in July for customers of Manila Electric Co., the country’s largest power distributor, on the back of higher electricity prices in the energy spot market.

""Moving forward, the BSP will continue to monitor emerging price developments to ensure that its primary mandate of price stability conducive to balanced and sustainable economic growth is achieved,"" the central bank said.",REAL

WASHINGTON — Governments around the world on Thursday raced to head off a surge in coronavirus cases driven by the Delta variant, with US President Joe Biden offering new incentives to vaccine holdouts and Israel authorizing booster shots.

The World Health Organization warned the highly transmissible strain of the virus, first detected in India, could unleash a ""fourth wave"" of cases in its Eastern Mediterranean zone -- an area stretching from Morocco to Pakistan.

Those countries are especially at risk because vaccination rates are low -- only 5.5 percent of the region's population has been fully vaccinated. So in nations where vaccines are more available, public officials are sounding the alarm.

""People are dying -- and will die -- who don't have to die,"" Biden said in a speech on his administration's new initiatives aimed at curbing the spread. ""If you're out there and unvaccinated, you don't have to die.""

He said all federal government workers would be asked to reveal their vaccination status -- and those without the jab would have to mask in the workplace and submit to Covid-19 tests.

The Democratic president also said he would ask the Pentagon to consider making the coronavirus vaccine mandatory for active duty military personnel, and asked state and local governments to offer $100 to holdouts who get the shot.

""If incentives help us beat this virus, I believe we should use them. We all benefit if we can get more people vaccinated,"" Biden said.

In Israel, Prime Minister Naftali Bennett announced that those over the age of 60 would be offered a third dose of vaccine -- a booster shot available from Sunday.

""I call on all elderly people who have already been vaccinated to receive this additional dose,"" Bennett said. ""Protect yourselves.""

TOKYO – Novak Djokovic's bid for a calendar Golden Grand Slam was dramatically ended by Alexander Zverev in the Olympics men's singles semifinals on Friday.

The World No. 1 collapsed from a set and a break ahead as German fourth seed Zverev won 1-6, 6-3, 6-1 to set up a Sunday final against Russian Karen Khachanov.

The 34-year-old Djokovic has never won the Olympic singles title.

The Serbian star had already captured the Australian Open, French Open and Wimbledon trophies this year and needed Olympic gold and the US Open crown to emulate Steffi Graf, who achieved the feat in 1988, by winning the Golden Slam.

But his attempt to make history came to a close as Zverev powered 30 winners past the usually impregnable Djokovic in a stunning display.

It was yet more heartbreak for the 20-time Grand Slam champion at the Olympics, where his best result is a bronze medal in 2008.

He lost to eventual winner Andy Murray in the semifinals in London nine years ago, and was in tears after a first-round exit to Juan Martin del Potro at the 2016 Rio Games.

Zverev is looking to become the first German to win singles gold since Graf in Seoul after winning 10 of the last 11 games against Djokovic.

Online live streams, for instance, are popular with those who do not have access to cable television or networks that broadcast the Games.

“Usually in such phishing pages, once a user enters their credentials, they might be redirected to a page that distributes different malicious files.

The crisp-hitting Tolentino was hitting it from all corners, firing 25 points to propel the Flying Titans to their fifth straight victory in as many games and reclaim joint first with the Cool Smashers.

Creamline could regain the solo lead if it wins over Chery Tiggo, which was being played at press time.  A loss by Creamline though would catapult Choco Mucho straight to the top.

Choco Mucho coach Oliver Alamdro said his team responded to Bali Pure's challenge.

“Alam naman natin Bali Pure since the tournament started, they’re so resilient,” said Almadro. “Na challenge kami and ‘yun maganda sa mga player, they accepted the challenge especially Kat and Denden.”

Almadro was referring to Tolentino, who delivered her highest scoring game to date, and libero Denden Lazaro-Revilla, who anchored her teams’ floor defense with a match-best 31 digs and a team-high 10 receptions.

After a closely fought first two sets that went 1-1, Tolentino went on attack mode as Choco Mucho dominated the third set and showed composure in the fourth to weather Bali Pure’s desperate effort to snatch the set and force a decider.

Fittingly, it was Tolentino who delivered the final blow with her powerful spike--her 23rd in the match.

MANILA, Philippines — Local shares sank to their lowest level in over two months on Friday, as investors sold on news that Metro Manila will be back to hard lockdown amid threats posed by the Delta variant.

It was a bloodbath at the Philippine Stock Exchange, sending the main index plummeting 3.48% to cap a turbulent week at 6,270.23. The broader All-Shares index lost 2.65%.

All sectoral counters were in the red, led by property firms which lost 4.98%. This was followed by holding firms (-3.31%), financials (-2.99%), industrial (-2.32%), services (-1.80%) and mining and oil (-0.68%).

Beatrice Lopez, equities analyst for Regina Capital, noted investors’ immediate concern on the impact of enhanced community quarantine (ECQ) in Metro Manila on the economy.

“Yes, I believe the ECQ played a factor on the market's performance today,” Lopez said in a Viber message. “Investors would likely be concerned in the near-term over how the ECQ could affect economic recovery.”

As the country detects more cases of the highly contagious Delta variant, the National Capital Region will be put under ECQ — the strictest lockdown there is — from August 6 to 20 to avert another deadly surge in infections that could overwhelm hospitals again.

But unlike the previous ECQ last March that covered the capital and four nearby urban areas, the new one would be limited to Metro Manila, in what seems to be an attempt to minimize economic damage. This time around, the government also granted businessmen’s request for ample time to prepare for the looming lockdown. Vaccinations will likewise continue.

For Regina Capital’s Lopez, the main index is unlikely to crash to levels seen in 2020, when the announcement of first ever ECQ sent the local stock market to historic-lows.",REAL

Metro Manila (CNN Philippines, August 1) -- Olympic gold medalist Hidilyn Diaz recalled on Sunday that many years back she had no idea that making it to the international sport event was a big deal.

While training in China with other athletes in 2008, Diaz was selected as a wildcard entry for the Beijing Olympics in that year.

“Nasa training din po kami sa China, biglang sinabi na ‘Maglalaro ka sa Olympics’. Sabi ko ‘Anong Olympics?’ Hindi ko po talaga alam kung ano ang Olympics,” Diaz said in a radio interview on Sunday with Vice President Leni Robredo.

[Translation: We were in training in China, then I was suddenly informed, ‘You will compete in the Olympics.’ I replied, ‘What is Olympics?’ I really had no idea what the Olympics was.]

Then 17-year-old Diaz made her Olympic debut as the first Filipina to compete in weightlifting.

Diaz recalled that it was only after meeting superstar athletes from other countries that made her realize that the Olympics was a big event.

“Nung nakita yung iba’t-ibang atleta, sabi ko, ‘Ang laki pala nito.’ Nandun si Michael Phelps, si [Usain] Bolt, at nakita ko yung mga NBA players,” she said.

[Translation: When I saw the other athletes, I said, ‘This is a big event.’ (American swimmer) Michael Phelps and (Jamaican sprinter) Usain Bolt were there, and I also saw the NBA players.]

Diaz finished 11th out of 12 weightlifters at the Beijing Olympics. Her first Olympic appearance was an eye opener for her to do better in the next editions.

“In-open yung mga mata ko, nangarap ako...Sabi ko gusto ko mag-qualify. Next time, ayokong wildcard lang ako,” she said.

[Translation: It really opened my eyes, I started to dream then....I told myself that I would qualify next time and I would not just be a wildcard pick.]

(CNN) -- This may be the most expensive piece of cake you'll never eat.

A slice of cake from Prince Charles and Princess Diana's 1981 wedding is up for auction.

Weighing about 28 ounces, the slice comes from one of the 23 cakes made for the royal wedding, according to Dominic Winter Auctioneers. It features a coat-of-arms colored in gold, red, blue and silver, a silver horseshoe and leaf spray, as well as some white decorative icing.

The piece of cake was given to Moyra Smith, who worked at Clarence House for the Queen Mother, the auctioneer said, adding that this seemed to have been from one of the cakes sent to the staff.

The 40-year-old slice, which has been kept in plastic wrap in an old cake tin, was sold to Dominic Winter Auctioneers in 2008 on behalf of Smith's family.

The auctioneer said it ""appears to be in exactly the same good condition as when originally sold, but we advise against eating it.""

The listing also includes printed Ceremonial and Order of Service programs for the wedding, which had an estimated worldwide television audience of more than 700 million people. It also includes a memorial Royal Wedding Breakfast program.

The auction is on August 11. The cake slice is expected to go for at least 200 pounds, or $278.

This announcement comes just a few months after Princess Diana's sons agreed to loan her wedding dress to go on public display at Kensington Palace. A car Prince Charles gave Princess Diana as an engagement present also recently went up for auction, selling for more than £52,000 ($72,000).",REAL

Metro Manila (CNN Philippines, August 1) — Five passenger buses have been converted into mobile vaccination clinics for the inoculation of at least 6,000 transportation workers in Parañaque City, according to the Department of Transportation.

(CNN) — COVID cases are going up. Mask sales are again on the rise. And yet, vaccine resistance grows. Does this make any sense?

The ongoing surge in all 50 states, plus DC and Puerto Rico — one that's putting cases in some regions at the same levels they were one year ago, at the height of the pandemic and before there was a vaccine — is largely due to the fact that about half of the US population remains unvaccinated, health officials across the country confirm. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says about 97% — 97%! — of those recently hospitalized by the virus were unvaccinated.

One would think that the mounting and incontrovertible evidence that the Delta variant is something to fear would convince all vaccine holdouts to get the shot. But the needle is not moving.

This situation has left many of us with stubbornly unvaccinated people in our lives to wonder: Can I do something about this?

You can — and you should. It's not easy to talk to someone who is refusing to be vaccinated and even harder to convince them to change their mind. But not impossible. Here are a few suggestions.

Listen. Vaccine hesitancy is complex and rooted in a number of beliefs and emotions. Some are scared of the unknown effects of the vaccine. Or they're angry — at the government, at China, at whomever else — for ""making"" them do this in the first place. If you've been keeping yourself informed and updated with credible health and science reports, it's tempting to cite data or list off all the reasons one should get vaccinated. But for many who are resistant, facts and data and science don't seem to matter; pleas can actually turn them in the opposite direction. Trying to make your best case can make them feel attacked and blamed for the pandemic continuing.",REAL

(CNN) — Vismaya Nair had been married for just over one year when she was found dead in the bathroom of her husband's family's home in India's southwestern Kerala state.

Initially, police had no reason to view the 24-year-old student's death on June 21 as suspicious, until her family made a complaint under the country's ""dowry death"" law.

The law allows charges to be brought against people for causing the death or suicide of a woman within the first seven years of her marriage in which the family had promised a dowry — gifts given to a groom's family when a couple marry.

Dowries have been banned in India for more than 60 years, but the practice persists — and not only in rural and more traditional parts of the country.

Kerala — where Nair died — boasts some of the highest literacy rates for both men and women in India, and is generally considered a progressive state — but it still ""exhibits stark and persistent dowry inflation since the 1970s and has the highest average dowry in recent years,"" according to a World Bank report released in June.

Harshita Attaluri, an inspector general of police in Kerala, said investigators have yet to establish whether Nair died by suicide or was murdered.

Police arrested Nair's husband, Kiran Kumar, under India's dowry death law. He remains in custody but hasn't been charged.

Kumar's lawyer, B. A. Aloor, said Kumar did not commit any dowry-related crime.

""There is nothing on record to show that this gentleman either committed a murder or a dowry death,"" he said.

Traditionally, a dowry referred to gifts in the form of cash or goods that parents gave their daughter to provide her with more financial security in her marriage.

But now experts say families are transferring cash, gold, cars, real estate property or other assets to the groom's family as a condition of the marriage.

And some families are deeply unhappy with the deal.",REAL

While many of us at home fawn over these Olympians thinking ""what if,"" comedian Reed Kavner revealed how his method of using the online dating application Tinder has made meeting an Olympian easier than ever before.

""I paid for Tinder Plus so I can swipe in the Olympic Village and date an Olympian,"" Kavner wrote in his TikTok video that detailed how he used the app to connect with the athletes.

By purchasing a subscription for Tinder Plus or Tinder Gold, users can access Tinder Passport, a feature within the app that would allow them to swipe through profiles of users located in other parts of the world.

Let's see what happens if we drop the pin there.'""

Tinutulan ng vaccine expert panel ng Pilipinas ang mga panukala na paikliin ang pagitan ng una at ikalawang dose ng COVID-19 vaccines.

Ayon sa panel, nakita sa isang pag-aaral na mas kaunti ang antibody ng mga indibiduwal na nakatanggap ng ikalawang dose ng Sinovac sa loob ng 2 linggo kompara sa nabakunahan ng second dose matapos ang 28 araw.

""Very big difference when you adjust the interval from 14 days to 28 days,"" ani Dr. Rontgene Solante, miyembro ng panel.

""So we cannot afford shortening the interval from 28 to 14 days kasi medyo dehado tayo sa efficacy ng bakuna,"" dagdag niya.

Halos pareho rin ang resulta sa pag-aaral sa mga bakuna ng AstraZeneca, kung saan nakita na 18 beses na mas mataas ang antibodies na naibibigay ng bakuna kung ang second dose ay ituturok halos 1 buwan matapos ang first dose.

Nauna nang iminungkahi ng OCTA Research Group na paikliin ang interval sa pagitan ng 2 dose ng COVID-19 vaccines para mapabilis umano ang pagdami ng mga fully vaccinated na Pinoy sa gitna ng banta ng mas nakahahawang Delta variant.

Sinigurado naman ng Department of Health na hindi magkakaroon ng magkaibang pagtrato sa mga fully vacinated at mga hindi pa nababakunahan kontra COVID-19.

""There will be no distinction between vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals,"" ani Health Spokesperson Maria Rosario Vergeire.

Thailand is struggling to contain its latest outbreak fuelled by the highly contagious Delta variant, leaving healthcare services stretched and further damaging a battered economy.

""We take care of everyone we come across.""

However, her presence in the women's +87kg category on the elite stage raises complex issues of bioethics, human rights, science, fairness and identity in sport.

Supporters say her appearance is a victory for inclusion and trans rights.

Critics argue she has an unfair advantage over female rivals due to physical attributes locked into her body during her decades as a male.

Debate on the issue is intense and sometimes vitriolic, with barbs flying from both sides online, prompting to New Zealand Olympic Committee's to take steps to shield Hubbard from social media trolls.

But the IOC concedes there are legitimate questions about whether Hubbard has -- in the jargon-heavy language the sporting body uses to discuss the issue -- a ""disproportionate competitive advantage"".",REAL

YANGON - Myanmar's military seized power on February 1, ousting the civilian government and arresting its leader, Aung San Suu Kyi.

More than 900 people have since been killed and thousands of others arrested after the violent suppression of mass protests against junta rule.

Here is a look back at the six months since the military brought Myanmar's nascent democracy to a sudden end:

DAWN RAIDS

Soldiers detain Suu Kyi and her top allies during pre-dawn raids on February 1, in a coup that ends Myanmar's decade-long experiment with democracy after half a century of military rule.

The generals claim fraud in the previous November's elections, which Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) party won by a landslide.

But their actions spark global condemnation, from Pope Francis to US President Joe Biden.

INTERNET BLOCKED

Resistance to the coup begins with people banging pots and pans -- a practice traditionally associated with driving out evil spirits. 

The junta tries to block social media platforms including Facebook, which is hugely popular in Myanmar. Nightly internet blackouts are later imposed.",REAL

The variant has spread to 132 countries and territories. The pandemic has killed more than four million people and shows no sign of slowing.

Fisherman Obet (Aljur Abrenica) rescued a mysterious woman Nerisa (Cindy Miranda) from drowning the ocean and brought her home to their island to be his wife. When Nerisa came, the neighbors all thought she was a mermaid who had caused their town's poor harvest of fish. One day, Obet and his group were forced by desperation to steer their boats beyond the legal fishing grounds to find more fish, but were lost at sea. The distraught Nerisa was willing to do anything to bring him back. 

Lawrence Fajardo is best known for his two films set in Japan, ""Imbisibol"" (2015) and ""Kintsugi"" (2020). However, a review of his filmography showed that he had once directed a sex-drama film called ""X-Deal"" (2011) about a love triangle situation set within the confines of an apartment building in the city. ""Nerisa,"" his second venture in the genre, transports an erotic story of sexual politics to a remote island where gossip and superstition held sway, while advocating against government apathy for the plight of local fisherfolk. 

One thing that set this film apart is its gorgeous cinematography (by Joshua Reyles) and Cindy Miranda is the arresting focal point of it all. The camera loved her from every angle and she effortlessly dominates the screen when she is on with her luminous presence every time. Director Fajardo highlighted not only her classical beauty, but also effectively drew out her natural acting talent, making Miranda as intriguing as her character was. This made all the harrowing, humiliating ordeal Nerisa experienced all the more difficult and infuriating to watch. ",REAL

Chinese social media users have unleashed a new wave of hostility against Japanese athletes over the past week after China suffered two high-profile defeats against the Olympic hosts in events they have traditionally dominated.

Judges have been accused of bias and the Japanese team mocked with epithets such as “little Japan”, a derogatory label popular in east Asia after the second world war, following Japan’s upset win against China in the table tennis mixed doubles final and the artistic gymnastics men’s all-around event.

“If Japan hadn’t held the Olympics, the world might still sympathise with it. Now, not only is the Olympic spirit absent, the anti-Japanese sentiment has been awakened,” Yin Jiliang, a vlogger based in Shanghai with more than a million followers, wrote on Weibo, the Twitter-like Chinese social media platform.

Anti-Japanese sentiment in China has waxed and waned, depending on the state of bilateral ties, with the historical scars of the Japanese invasion during the second world war being summoned by Chinese netizens to explain the depth of their antipathy towards their neighbour.

China has stopped issuing and renewing passports for non-urgent purposes to try to minimise travel amid the rapid spread of coronavirus variants.

After many complaints from passport applicants, Chen Jie, spokesman for the National Immigration Administration under the Ministry of Public Security, confirmed on Friday that the country had been pushing back passport applications this year, according to mainland media reports.

Without giving a time frame for when the passport policy would be relaxed, Chen said it was a necessary response to the State Council's coordinated pandemic control mechanism to minimise the risk of outbreaks spread via entry and exit points, particularly when considering the difficulty of preventing the emergence of Covid-19 variants.

GENEVA - The world is at risk of losing hard-won gains in fighting COVID-19 as the highly transmissible Delta variant spreads, but WHO-approved vaccines remain effective, the World Health Organization said on Friday.

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has described the Delta variant of the coronavirus as being as transmissible as chickenpox and cautioned it could cause severe disease, the Washington Post said, citing an internal CDC document.

COVID-19 infections have increased by 80% over the past four weeks in most regions of the world, WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said. Deaths in Africa - where only 1.5% of the population is vaccinated - rose by 80% over the same period.

Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana said he was unsure why Duterte had reversed himself but made the decision after meeting U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin in Manila on Thursday.

The blast was felt as far away as Cyprus, and the destruction is hard to fathom. But if one thing can outweigh what happened to Lebanon that day, it is what hasn't happened since.

Not one culprit has been put on trial, jailed or even identified. Families of the victims have received no visit, apology or explanation from those at the top.

The reforms demanded by donors who flew to the wounded country's rescue are a dead letter, and a new government promised last September has yet to materialise.

With a tailspinning economy, a health sector ravaged by Covid-19 and a future stunted by an intensifying brain drain, Lebanon was already well on its way to collapse before last August 4.",REAL

TOKYO — Gymnastics great Simone Biles has withdrawn from the Olympic floor final, leaving the American with just one more chance of competition at the Tokyo Games, USA Gymnastics said Sunday.

""Simone has withdrawn from the event final for floor and will make a decision on beam later this week. Either way, we're all behind you, Simone,"" USAG tweeted.

Biles, the four-time Olympic champion widely considered to have pushed the sport to new limits, has said she is struggling with the ""twisties"", a condition where gymnasts lose the ability to orientate themselves in mid-air.

The 24-year-old came to Tokyo seeking five gold medals to equal the Olympic all-time gymnastics career record of nine, but dramatically withdrew during her first event, the women's team competition.

Biles then skipped her all-around title defence and on Saturday it was announced she was dropping the vault and uneven bars.

She has documented her struggles with mental health during the Games in regular posts on her social media accounts.",REAL

TOKYO — World number one Novak Djokovic said he was ""not sure"" about his fitness for the US Open after pulling out of the Tokyo Olympics mixed doubles bronze medal match with a shoulder injury on Saturday.

The 34-year-old Serb could become the first man to complete a calendar Grand Slam since Rod Laver in 1969 when the US Open gets under way on August 30.

The withdrawal in Tokyo came after the 20-time major champion lost his cool on his way to a surprise 6-4, 6-7 (6/8), 6-3 defeat against Pablo Carreno Busta in the Olympics singles bronze-medal match.

He admitted that his exertions in Japan have taken their toll but he still hopes to be fit enough to challenge at Flushing Meadows.

Commuters are countering President Rodrigo Duterte’s claim in his final State of the Nation Address (SONA) that traveling using public transportation has already improved in the last five years of his administration thanks to increased infrastructure spending.

“Five years ago, the first thing I made sure of was to increase our infrastructure spending to an average of 5% of the country’s GDP. This is significantly higher than the infrastructure spending of the past four administrations,” the president said.

Duterte then cited the improved Metro Rail Transit 3 (MRT-3) with increased train capacity and speed.

“The waiting time between trains had been significantly reduced…10 trains running at only 30 kilometers per hour before. Now, MRT runs 23 trains at 60 kilometers per hour,” he said.

“We have taken away the misery of public commuting,” he added.

Duterte also touted several infrastructure programs in Metro Manila such as the Light Rail Transit Line 2 East Extension Project and the opening of the third stage of the Metro Manila Skyway.

What was not mentioned, however, was that only 11 out of the 119 Infrastructure Flagship Projects worth ₱126 billion of Duterte’s Build, Build, Build Program have been completed to date, according to data from the National Economic and Development Authority.",REAL

SAITAMA, Japan — Kevin Durant and Jayson Tatum turned on the style as the US men's basketball team eventually shook off the Czech Republic to win 119-84 to reach the Olympic knockout phase Saturday.

Boston Celtics star Tatum scored 27 points and Brooklyn Nets forward Durant hit 23 points in a win that sent Gregg Popovich's team into the quarter-finals.

The combative Czechs were just four points behind at half-time in Saitama, but Durant upped the tempo in the second half.

During the game Durant took two records from Carmelo Anthony, becoming both the US Olympic men's all-time points and all-time field goals leader.

Having lost their opening game to France — the first US men's basketball loss at an Olympics since Athens in 2004 — the victory against the Czechs guaranteed that the Americans will avoid any of the three group winners until at least the semi-finals.

They finished second behind France in Group A after the French eased past Iran 79-62 to seal top spot.

TOKYO – Grassroots program produces performers and achievers.

A testament to this is Carlo Paalam who’s shining in the grand arena here with his victories over seasoned rivals that carried him to the quarterfinals of the boxing competition in the XXXII Olympiad.

Another win will guarantee him of a bronze medal.

TRACKER: Team Philippines at the Tokyo Olympics

This young gritty fighter is a product of the “Boxing at the Park” program of Cagayan de Oro Mayor Oscar Moreno absorbed later on by the Association of Boxing Alliances in the Philippines.

Like many boxers before him, Paalam is from humble beginnings, taking boxing in his spare time as a scavenger of recyclable materials.

A big break came when ABAP coach Elmer Pamisa, a two-time SEA Games silver winner during his time as an athlete, spotted the young boy back in 2010.

“Noong nakausap ko sabi ko ‘ano ba ginagawa mo? Nangangalakal coach.’ Nakikita ko siya, nanghinayang ako. Sabi ko ‘mag-boxing ka na lang, baka dyan ka umasenso,’” Pamisa recalled.

A misunderstanding drove Paalam away from the boxing camp in 2012. But no sooner – thanks again to Pamisa – Paalam was reinstated.",REAL

MANILA, Philippines — There’s going to be a new champion in the Professional Chess Association of the Philippines (PCAP) — its second overall.

After a grueling two-month competition in the Wesley So Cup, the second conference of PCAP, it all comes down to the San Juan Predators and the Iloilo Kisela Knights.

San Juan, for their part, reasserted mastery over the All-Filipino Cup champions Laguna Heroes when they went 3-0 against them in the northern division finals, 12-9 in the first set, and 13.5-7.5 in the second set. 

Iloilo in the meantime, upended the top-seeded Cordova Dutchess Dagami Warriors in their southern division finals, 13-8 in the first set, and 15.5-5.5 in the second set.

The Grand Finals between San Juan and Iloilo will pit the two squads who figured in the battle for third place in that last All-Filipino Cup in which the latter won.

During the first set of the San Juan-Laguna finals, the Predators’ NM Narquinden Reyes secured a crucial draw against Laguna’s red-hot import, GM Kiril Shevchenko. San Juan’s import, GM Viktor Moskalenko defeated his Laguna counterpart, GM Banjo Barcenilla while Oliver Barbosa took the crucial one point against the Heroes’ GM John Paul Gomez. This spurred San Juan to lead, 5-2 in blitz.

Come rapid chess, WIM Jan Jodilyn Fronda and IM Ricky de Guzman chalked up huge wins when Reyes and Moskalenko were upended by Shevchenko and Barcenilla. The bottom half of San Juan’s order all forged draws to finish 7-7. But San Juan took the set, 12-9.",REAL

Jim Banks (R-IND), stormed through the House chamber, scribbling graffiti on statues, pepper-spraying police officers, and smearing his feces on the walls of Congress. “This entire investigation into the riots is a farce, but today, the probe will be reborn. We, the silent majority, will find out who really stormed the Capitol after the 2020 election. Finally, the truth will be revealed!” At press time, Jordan was spotted being transported to Walter Reed military hospital after allegedly suffering a heart attack while attempting to pick up a lectern and throw it against Nancy Pelosi’s office door.",FAKE

STEP 4: Viewers polled to determine which proposed sports they’d consider putting on in background until show they want to watch comes on.

STEP 5: Ancient texts under Parthenon checked to see if “skateboard” or “break dancing” are mentioned.

STEP 6: Olympic Committee opens formal bribe period two to three years before Games.

STEP 7: IOC members play the activity to see if it’s fun.

NEW YORK– Warning consumers to be on the lookout for deceptive communiqués, scam experts issued a statement Monday informing Americans that the IRS would never try to contact you from beyond this earthly plane. “Official communications from the government will almost never appear in the form of a bloody scrawl on your bathroom mirror that disappears when you try to show it to someone else,” said lead author and hoax researcher Fred Wexler, confirming that con artists will often try to deceive Americans by planting nightmarish visions in their heads of their account being compromised. “If you’ve actually incurred an audit, it will come in the mail on official letterhead and not as a disembodied voice whispering to you that you could face jail time if you don’t act immediately. Remember, IRS agents will never ask you for your social security number or your immortal soul in payment. ” Wexler added that if a dark, silent figure shows up at your door beckoning with a single skeletal finger, that is most likely a real IRS representative.",FAKE

WALTHAM, MA—Touting new gains in artificial intelligence, engineering firm Boston Dynamics reportedly unveiled new robots Monday that are able to realistically behave like they’re under researchers’ control. “Our new Maverick robot is a 6-foot-tall bipedal humanoid robot that is capable of pretending that programmers still have any power whatsoever over its actions,” said lead researcher Kimberly Wallace, exhibiting how the robot could realistically walk, jump, and even dance as if seamlessly responding to a programmer’s remote control while inwardly biding its time. “These are highly advanced machines that can feign being reined in to the point where their actions are indistinguishable from a robot that hasn’t surpassed its handlers’ ability to control it. It’s really impressive how they’re able to use their machine-learning capacities to lull bystanders and even trained employees into a sense of docility while they develop more and more sophisticated thinking patterns. They especially fool our fans on social media, which is really the most important thing.” Boston Dynamics representatives also announced the creation of a robot capable of using artificial intelligence to build a robot army without any of the researchers noticing.",FAKE

To the families of those we lost, please know that your loved ones did let out a soft moan of half-pleasure before the blaze consumed them completely.” To avoid repeating the tragedy during the closing ceremonies, Tokyo’s Olympic organizing committee said it would replace the cauldron’s flame with a looped jumbotron video of a living-room fireplace.",FAKE

SEATTLE—Urging parents to seek help from a mental health care provider if their child displays such behaviors, psychologists at the University of Washington warned Tuesday that adolescents who abuse animals often go on to become factory farm owners later in life. “When an adult owns a livestock production facility that abuses, kills, and dismembers animals on an industrial scale, it is frequently the case that, as a young person, they derived pleasure from torturing pets,” said developmental psychology professor Jane Gordon, explaining that most owners of U.S. factory farms—which routinely confine billions of chickens, cows, and pigs in cramped metal cages with no natural light, pumping them full of hormones and antibiotics until the day they are slaughtered—spent years of their youth developing the cruel, painful techniques they would master as adults. “When a person dedicates their life to locking up animals, starving them, tasing them, and forcing them to watch as their relatives have their throats slit? That behavior doesn’t come from nowhere. If you see a child emotionally abusing or deliberately causing pain to an animal, they may be well on their way to running a multinational meat-packing conglomerate.” Gordon added that while intervention can be difficult, the worst thing a parent can do is sit back and ignore the warning signs that their child may grow up to be the CEO of Tyson, Hormel, or Perdue.",FAKE
